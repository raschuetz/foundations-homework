      "mr. chairman , i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time . \n",
      "my good colleague from california raised the exact and critical point . \n",
      "the question is , what happens during those 45 days ? \n",
      "we will need to support elections . \n",
      "there is not a single member of this house who has not supported some form of general election , a special election , to replace the members at some point . \n",
      "but during that 45 days , what happens ? \n",
      "the chair of the constitution subcommittee says this is what happens : martial law . \n",
      "we do not know who would fill the vacancy of the presidency , but we do know that the succession act most likely suggests it would be an unelected person . \n",
      "the sponsors of the bill before us today insist , and i think rightfully so , on the importance of elections . \n",
      "but to then say that during a 45-day period we would have none of the checks and balances so fundamental to our constitution , none of the separation of powers , and that the presidency would be filled by an unelected member of the cabinet who not a single member of this country , not a single citizen , voted to fill that position , and that that person would have no checks and balances from congress for a period of 45 days i find extraordinary . \n",
      "i find it inconsistent . \n",
      "i find it illogical , and , frankly , i find it dangerous . \n",
      "the gentleman from wisconsin refused earlier to yield time , but i was going to ask him , if virginia has those elections in a shorter time period , they should be commended for that . \n",
      "so now we have a situation in the congress where the virginia delegation has sent their members here , but many other states do not have members here . \n",
      "do they at that point elect a speaker of the house in the absence of other members ? \n",
      "and then three more states elect their representatives , temporary replacements , or full replacements at that point . \n",
      "they come in . \n",
      "do they elect a new speaker ? \n",
      "and if that happens , who becomes the president under the succession act ? \n",
      "this bill does not address that question . \n",
      "this bill responds to real threats with fantasies . \n",
      "it responds with the fantasy , first of all , that a lot of people will still survive ; but we have no guarantee of that . \n",
      "it responds with the fantasy that those who do survive will do the right thing . \n",
      "we are here having this debate , we have debates every day , because people differ on what the right thing is to do . \n",
      "i have been in very traumatic situations with people in severe car wrecks and mountain climbing accidents . \n",
      "my experience has not been that crisis imbues universal sagacity and fairness . \n",
      "it has not been that . \n",
      "people respond in extraordinary ways , and we must preserve an institution that has the deliberative body and the checks and balances to meet those challenges . \n",
      "many of our states are going increasingly to mail-in ballots . \n",
      "we in this body were effectively disabled by an anthrax attack not long after september 11 . \n",
      "i would ask my dear friends , will you conduct this election in 45 days if there is anthrax in the mail and still preserve the franchise of the american people ? \n",
      "how will you do that ? \n",
      "you have no answer to that question . \n",
      "i find it extraordinary , frankly , that while saying you do not want to amend the constitution , we began this very congress by amending the constitution through the rule , by undermining the principle that a quorum is 50 percent of the body and instead saying it is however many people survive . \n",
      "and if that rule applies , who will designate it , who will implement it ? \n",
      "the speaker , or the speaker 's designee ? \n",
      "again , not an elected person , as you say is so critical and i believe is critical , but a temporary appointee , frankly , who not a single other member of this body knows who they are . \n",
      "so we not only have an unelected person , we have an unknown person who will convene this body , and who , by the way , could conceivably convene it for their own election to then become the president of the united states under the succession act . \n",
      "you have refused steadfastly to debate this real issue broadly . \n",
      "you had a mock debate in the committee on the judiciary in which the distinguished chairman presented my bill without allowing me the courtesy or dignity to defend it myself . \n",
      "and on that , you proudly say you defend democracy . \n",
      "sir , i think you dissemble in that regard . \n",
      "here is the fundamental question for us , my friends , and it is this : the american people are watching television and an announcement comes on and says the congress has been destroyed in a nuclear attack , the president and vice president are killed and the supreme court is dead and thousands of our citizens in this town are . \n",
      "what happens next ? \n",
      "under your bill , 45 days of chaos . \n",
      "apparently , according to the committee on the judiciary subcommittee on the constitution chairman , 45 days of marshal law , rule of this country by an unelected president with no checks and balances . \n",
      "or an alternative , an alternative which says quite simply that the people have entrusted the representatives they send here to make profound decisions , war , taxation , a host of other things , and those representatives would have the power under the bill of the gentleman from california ( mr. rohrabacher ) xz4003430 bill or mine to designate temporary successors , temporary , only until we can have a real election . \n",
      "the american people , in one scenario , are told we do not know who is going to run the country , we have no representatives ; where in another you will have temporary representatives carrying your interests to this great body while we deliberate and have real elections . \n",
      "that is the choice . \n",

      "it simply is not . \n",
      "it leaves our country vulnerable for 45 days and that is too long . \n",
      "the distinguished chairman of the committee on the judiciary made some comments recently that suggested that somehow terrorists would oppose this bill and by some implication would favor the bill the gentleman from california ( mr. rohrabacher ) xz4003430 and i have put forward because it seems to support their autocratic views of government . \n",
      "nothing could be further from the truth . \n",
      "in fact , what our bill would do is tell the terrorists , you could come on a single day and set off a nuclear weapon in this town and kill every single member of us ; and though we would be missed , the very next day the congress would be up and functioning with every single state , every single district having full representation by statesmen and stateswomen at a time of national crisis . \n",
      "that is what the gentleman from california ( mr. rohrabacher ) xz4003430 and i are trying to do . \n",
      "we are trying to tell the terrorists , you can kill all of us as individuals , but you will not defeat this institution . \n",
      "you will not defeat the principle of representation . \n",
      "you will not defeat the principles of checks and balances . \n",
      "you will not impose martial law . \n",
      "here is the irony . \n",
      "if terrorists hit us today when we finally vote on this , let us suppose a few democrats do not make it over here . \n",
      "you are leaving this country vulnerable to change in power . \n",
      "if the terrorists were to strike your conference retreat where the president speaks to the republican house and senate members and kill hundreds of house and senate members on the republican side , the democrats at that point claim the majority . \n",
      "the democrats at that point elect a speaker of the house . \n",
      "i am a democrat , for goodness sakes ; but that is not the way to leave our country vulnerable . \n",
      "you are leaving your own party , you are leaving the will of the people through their elections vulnerable . \n",
      "if we have temporary replacements , you immediately reconstitute the house ; you immediately ensure representation ; you assure that you maintain the balance of political power ; and you do it in an orderly , structured way with no chaos , in a way that is constitutionally valid by definition . \n",
      "what you have proposed is not necessarily constitutionally valid . \n",
      "it leaves the terrorists able to change our system of government . \n",
      "it depends on a fantasy immediate or quick election . \n",
      "it does not allow really qualified people necessarily to get here and act in time . \n",
      "there are so many things you have left undone . \n",
      "you are going to try to say that at the start of this year we have solved this problem ; let us go home . \n",
      "you have not solved the problem , and it is a doggone disgrace , and it is a danger to this country . \n",
      "the other day a gentleman testified before the committee on the budget and said this : `` the lack of preparation for continuity , for true continuity invites attack. '' you are inviting attack . \n",

      "mr. chairman , i rise to make two fundamental points before we proceed to vote on this . \n",
      "the two points are these : this resolution does not solve the real problem and it may create more problems than it purports to solve , and we have to understand that . \n",
      "it does not solve the problem for this reason : by leaving us without a congress for 45 days , we essentially impose the opportunity for the executive branch to exert marshal law , and that is not what the framers of this country had in mind . \n",
      "this bill , if we do not provide some mechanism for prompt replacement other than this bill , will leave this country governed by an unelected executive , a cabinet member most likely who not a single american elected to that office . \n",
      "furthermore , it has a host of problems . \n",
      "it does not address the possibility that one delegation will elect its representatives more promptly than another . \n",
      "they will come to this body , choose one of its members as speaker . \n",
      "that person could move on to become the president . \n",
      "then another delegation comes in , et cetera . \n",
      "you are essentially leaving this country without a house of representatives , without checks and balances , without separation of powers , for at least 45 days , assuming an election can be held in 45 days and assuming that the terrorists through an anthrax attack , like they subjected this very capitol to , will not somehow undermine that ability . \n",
      "this is reality . \n",
      "we have seen the reality here . \n",
      "we saw those airplanes hit the buildings , we saw the anthrax , and yet we are not truly acting to solve this . \n",
      "mr. chairman , i yield to my distinguished friend , the gentleman from california ( mr. rohrabacher ) xz4003430 . \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4\n",
      "mr. chairman , reclaiming my time , let me make two final points : one , the majority party must understand this : if you are at a republican conference retreat and terrorists should strike you and kill the president and vice president and significant numbers of your side of the aisle , the democrats under your proposed law will obtain the majority , will elect a speaker of the house , and that person will then become the president of the united states of america . \n",
      "you are leaving this country vulnerable to that . \n",
      "you must not do it . \n",
      "you must not . \n",
      "this matter must be taken seriously . \n",
      "it deserves full debate . \n",
      "whether it is the proposal of the gentleman from california ( mr. rohrabacher ) xz4003430 and mine or others , we should commit to having this full house seriously consider this . \n",
      "if we do not and we are not fortunate , history will not look kindly upon the jeopardy in which we have left this great nation . \n",
      "vote no on this bill and insist on true debate on true continuity of congress in a responsible way that protects the balance of power , assures real succession to the presidency , and , most importantly , assures that your constituents will have representation at a time when our nation may well go to nuclear war , institute a draft , appropriate trillions of dollars , suspend habeas corpus and impose marshal law . \n",
      "you do not want that . \n",

      "mr. chairman , i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time . \n",
      "my good colleague from california raised the exact and critical point . \n",
      "the question is , what happens during those 45 days ? \n",
      "we will need to support elections . \n",
      "there is not a single member of this house who has not supported some form of general election , a special election , to replace the members at some point . \n",
      "but during that 45 days , what happens ? \n",
      "the chair of the constitution subcommittee says this is what happens : martial law . \n",
      "we do not know who would fill the vacancy of the presidency , but we do know that the succession act most likely suggests it would be an unelected person . \n",
      "the sponsors of the bill before us today insist , and i think rightfully so , on the importance of elections . \n",
      "but to then say that during a 45-day period we would have none of the checks and balances so fundamental to our constitution , none of the separation of powers , and that the presidency would be filled by an unelected member of the cabinet who not a single member of this country , not a single citizen , voted to fill that position , and that that person would have no checks and balances from congress for a period of 45 days i find extraordinary . \n",
      "i find it inconsistent . \n",
      "i find it illogical , and , frankly , i find it dangerous . \n",
      "the gentleman from wisconsin refused earlier to yield time , but i was going to ask him , if virginia has those elections in a shorter time period , they should be commended for that . \n",
      "so now we have a situation in the congress where the virginia delegation has sent their members here , but many other states do not have members here . \n",
      "do they at that point elect a speaker of the house in the absence of other members ? \n",
      "and then three more states elect their representatives , temporary replacements , or full replacements at that point . \n",
      "they come in . \n",
      "do they elect a new speaker ? \n",
      "and if that happens , who becomes the president under the succession act ? \n",
      "this bill does not address that question . \n",
      "this bill responds to real threats with fantasies . \n",
      "it responds with the fantasy , first of all , that a lot of people will still survive ; but we have no guarantee of that . \n",
      "it responds with the fantasy that those who do survive will do the right thing . \n",
      "we are here having this debate , we have debates every day , because people differ on what the right thing is to do . \n",
      "i have been in very traumatic situations with people in severe car wrecks and mountain climbing accidents . \n",
      "my experience has not been that crisis imbues universal sagacity and fairness . \n",
      "it has not been that . \n",
      "people respond in extraordinary ways , and we must preserve an institution that has the deliberative body and the checks and balances to meet those challenges . \n",
      "many of our states are going increasingly to mail-in ballots . \n",
      "we in this body were effectively disabled by an anthrax attack not long after september 11 . \n",
      "i would ask my dear friends , will you conduct this election in 45 days if there is anthrax in the mail and still preserve the franchise of the american people ? \n",
      "how will you do that ? \n",
      "you have no answer to that question . \n",
      "i find it extraordinary , frankly , that while saying you do not want to amend the constitution , we began this very congress by amending the constitution through the rule , by undermining the principle that a quorum is 50 percent of the body and instead saying it is however many people survive . \n",
      "and if that rule applies , who will designate it , who will implement it ? \n",
      "the speaker , or the speaker 's designee ? \n",
      "again , not an elected person , as you say is so critical and i believe is critical , but a temporary appointee , frankly , who not a single other member of this body knows who they are . \n",
      "so we not only have an unelected person , we have an unknown person who will convene this body , and who , by the way , could conceivably convene it for their own election to then become the president of the united states under the succession act . \n",
      "you have refused steadfastly to debate this real issue broadly . \n",
      "you had a mock debate in the committee on the judiciary in which the distinguished chairman presented my bill without allowing me the courtesy or dignity to defend it myself . \n",
      "and on that , you proudly say you defend democracy . \n",
      "sir , i think you dissemble in that regard . \n",
      "here is the fundamental question for us , my friends , and it is this : the american people are watching television and an announcement comes on and says the congress has been destroyed in a nuclear attack , the president and vice president are killed and the supreme court is dead and thousands of our citizens in this town are . \n",
      "what happens next ? \n",
      "under your bill , 45 days of chaos . \n",
      "apparently , according to the committee on the judiciary subcommittee on the constitution chairman , 45 days of marshal law , rule of this country by an unelected president with no checks and balances . \n",
      "or an alternative , an alternative which says quite simply that the people have entrusted the representatives they send here to make profound decisions , war , taxation , a host of other things , and those representatives would have the power under the bill of the gentleman from california ( mr. rohrabacher ) xz4003430 bill or mine to designate temporary successors , temporary , only until we can have a real election . \n",
      "the american people , in one scenario , are told we do not know who is going to run the country , we have no representatives ; where in another you will have temporary representatives carrying your interests to this great body while we deliberate and have real elections . \n",
      "that is the choice . \n",
      "you are making the wrong choice today if you think you have solved this problem . \n"
