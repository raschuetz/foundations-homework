AN: Curiosity killed the cat was only supposed to be a challenge fic for Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, for the testing of the product Super-sticky Laughing Stickers, with the guidelines that the main character must see some sort of secret, must feel an overwhelming emotion other than laugther or happiness and that it must be 2000 words long. The more I wrote it, though, the more I found myself wanting to continue it. I'm still playing with the idea of continuing it and am not quite sure that I should, but if you want me to continue please tell me, as I really want to. Review, please, and enjoy!Disclaimer: These characters do not belong to me, I'm just playing around with them!Hermione knew this was wrong. She knew that she should not be following Ron out of the common room at two in the morning, but she just couldn't help herself.When he had come sneaking down the staircase a few minutes ago, he had looked as if he was up to something, and if there's one thing that hadn't changed with Hermione over the years, it was her curiosity.It was curiosity that told her to keep silent and still in her chair before the fire, and curiosity that told her to go after Ron when she saw him sneaking out of the common room.She was lucky that he seemed so preoccupied with wherever he was sneaking of to, as she was not the most light-footed of persons.After about ten minutes of walking after her boyfriend, Hermione noticed that they were following the corridor leading to the kitchen, and she sighed, wishing she hadn't wasted her time in coming after him and planning to go back as soon as she saw him go into the kitchen, except he didn't.He continued on past the portrait of the basket of fruit and kept on walking until he came to an abandoned classroom a few passages on.Her curiosity and suspicious nature now fully aroused yet again, Hermione endeavoured to make her tread even softer as he slipped into the classroom.Stealthily, Hermione placed her foot in the way of the door just as it was about to swing shut, and peeked into the room.Though she had suspected something bad, she had no idea of just how bad it would be.When she peeked in, she saw Ron pressing a girl up against one of the desks, doing things that Ron had claimed he wasn't ready to do, no matter how much Hermione asked him to go further.As she saw them a feeling swept through her, so strong, she felt paralysed. Heart-stopping, gut-clenching, throat-clogging betrayal swept through her, finally coming to rest in her chest, where it was swiftly joined by such an all-compassing feeling of bitter anger, so strong, it almost swallowed the feeling of betrayal whole. Almost, but not quite.Hermione was fairly sure she had let out a horrified gasp when she first saw them, but so absorbed where they in their, illicit activities, that they didn't notice that slight sound.Fuming, anger supressing for the moment the tears she was sure would come later, she whispered a spell, and watched with malicious glee, as Ron jumped back with a cry as his lips and the girls turned into wriggling slugs stuck on their faces.A horrified look on his face, his hands raised to his mouth, Ron looked around and spotted Hermione.As he stepped away from the girl, Hermione recognized the rumpled hair and flushed, horrified face of Padma Patil, Parvati's sister in Ravenclaw. Sneering at her, her angry side now completely taking over, she turned to Ron, who was desperately trying to say something through his wriggling lips: "Wher.Mione..whar ape you fooing?"Rolling her eyes at his wrangled speech, and at his first words, being not an apology, but a demand to what she was doing."Oh, Ronald, I'm just saving you from what you told me you weren't ready to do, remember? As far as I recall, you claimed that you didn't feel ready touch me, as it made you too nervous, so I wouldn't want to make you more nervous than necessary," she said, pointing to the half-naked Padma, who was desperately trying to wriggle into her school shirt.Finally seeming to realise the predicament he was in, Ron's face turned white and he mumbled: "I'p po sowwee Whemione"His voice trailed off, as he searched for something to say that wouldn't leave him looking like a complete prat.Seeing him struggling, Hermione rolled her eyes and said: "Don't bother. We're over."Although it hurt her to admit it, she could swear she saw a second of relief on his face at being released from her, as she swung around and made her way back to the common room, till he realised he still had no idea how to get the slugs to turn back into lips, and he started calling after, panicking.Hermione ignored him. Now that her anger had worked itself out, it was quickly reverting back into the hurt and betrayal she had felt before the bitter anger had made its appearance.Although she struggled hard to contain her tears, she couldn't help that a few slipped out before she reached the common room.When she finally saw the portrait of the Fat Lady, she heaved a sigh of relief and, whispering the password, paying no heed to the Fat Lady's grumblings at being awoken, she slipped into the common room, intent only of getting up to her dormitory, crawling into her bed, placing silencing charms around her bed and crying her heart out.So focused was she on not letting the majority of her grief out before she reached her bed, that she didn't notice the dark figure sitting on one the chairs in front of the fire."Hermione? Are you okay?" the hesitant voice of Nevillle Longbottom, made her freeze with surprise.Turning around, she saw him unfolding his tall frame from the exact chair she had been sitting on earlier when she decided to follow Ron and saw-With a muffled cry, she flung herself against him, arms blindly going around him for comfort.Though he floundered a bit as she barrelled into him, he regained his composure and hesitantly put his arms around her back. When she gripped him even tighter and he felt the tell-tale wetness of tears trough his sweater, he started to soothingly rub her back, and carefully lowered them into the chair he had just vacated, settling Hermione on his lap.Hermione had no idea how long she sat on Neville's lap, his hand rubbing soothing circles into her back and she ruining his sweater with her tears, muffling her cries against his shoulder.When the tears and grief finally started relenting, she realised that Neville had begun stroking her head as well as rubbing her back, and that he was cooing nonsense into her ears as well as rocking her back and forth.Smiling a watery smile at his actions, she lifted her head from his shoulder, painfully aware now that she had rubbed her snot into his shoulder too, and that she had no handkerchief.Seeing her predicament, Neville pulled out a handkerchief from his pant pocket, and offered it to her.Taking it gratefully, she blew her nose and wiped it before stuffing it into her dressing gown pocket, resolving on washing it before she sent it back to him.As he shifted her around on his lap, she realised that the position she found herself in, wasn't exactly proper, as she was half reclining against his chest, and she knew that she wasn't the lightest girl ever.Apologising, her face flushing brilliantly, she climbed out of his lap.Waving her apology away, he too stood up, towering above her, and asked softly: "Want to tell me what this is all about?"She considered telling him he'll find out in the morning, but considering that he had held her while she cried, she thought he deserved a bit more than that. Feeling wrung out and fragile, she knew she had no more tears left right now so she nodded and opened her mouth to say what had happened, just as the common room door burst open and Ron came tumbling in, looking wildly around him for Hermione, who instinctively stood closer to Neville, who, seeing her backing away from him, came to stand half in front of her.Ron, barely noticing Neville's protective stance, opened his mouth as soon as he saw Hermione and said: "That was a mean trick Hermione, slugs for lips. If Padma hadn't known this spell and been able to do non-verbal spells, we would have had to go to Madame Pomfrey!"Wiping his mouth, as if he could still feel the slugs wriggling around on his lips, he continued, oblivious to Hermione's face regaining its angry flush, and Neville catching on to what was going on: "I'm sorry you had to find out this way Hermione, but did you honestly think a bloke would be happy with someone like you? You hardly ever come out of your books, and the only thing you ever talk about is your books. Any bloke would be put off by that. And don't let me get started on your looks! You-"That's as far as he got, for Neville had punched him squarely in the face, making him fall to the floor with the force of the blow, leaving Neville grimacing and clutching his hand, but looking down on Ron with a satisfied look.Hermione, who had grown steadily paler at Ron's words, rushed over to Neville to inspect his hand.Seeing his hand already had a little bruising, she told him to wait for her, and hurried up to her dormitory, with barely a glance in Ron's direction, where he was groaning on the floor and holding his nose.In the dormitory, she opened her trunk and looked for the Dittany, ignoring the grumbles of the other girls in her dorm to be quiet.Rushing down to the common room, she glanced down to where Ron had been lying, only to find no sign of him. Seeing her looking for him, Neville said: "I told him to get up to the dormitory before I hit him again."Smiling ruefully, but gratefully at Neville, she kneeled next to him and soaking the bandage she had brought with her in the Dittany, she bandaged his hand, ignoring his hisses of pain.Finished she glanced up at him looking down at her, and, suddenly feeling embarrassed for some reason or other, she stood up quickly and, thanking him for what he did, hurried up to her dormitory and slipped into her bed, not hearing Neville's whispered: "It's no problem"Burrowing her head into her pillow, she expected to feel some leftover anger and hurt, but instead she felt resigned.She suspected that she had always known, deep within, that she and Ron were not meant to be. They had come together out of a single kiss in the heat of battle, and even before it was over, she had known that something was not quite right.She had tried to ignore it though, as everyone seemed to expect them to be together, and Ron had shown no hint that he was reluctant to be with her.That was, till she, out of a knowledge that they ought to be doing more, had tried, during one of their kissing sessions, to take it further, only to be stopped by a blushing Ron, who said he wasn't ready.She had thought, then, that it was adorable that she was the one who was ready to go further and he wasn't, their roles very reversed to what she had been expecting.Only to find out now that it was all a farce, and that he just found her too repulsive to think of doing something like that with her.She felt a familiar pang of hurt, reminiscent to her childhood where she had been the bookworm and children had teased her, the boys long claiming she had cooties even after they had stopped saying that about other girls her age.Pushing that feeling away, she concentrated on the warm feeling that Neville's comfort had given her.Neville, who had finally grown out of his pudginess as a boy and grown into a tall and lean man. Neville, whose confidence had boomed after killing Nagini, but who was still afraid of girls and everything that that entailed. Neville, with his large, soothing hands, rubbing her back and stroking her head, murmuring comforting words into her ears, even when he hadn't known what was going on. Neville, who had stood up for her when Ron was saying such horrid things to her.Falling asleep, Hermione dreamed of big, calm, comforting hands.
