Lily Potters memories of Dominique Weasly.At 11 she laughed at me for my "boys hair cut".At 11 and a half she laughed at me for having no friends and my family hating me.At 12 she laughed at me for my only friend being a FREAK, like me.At 12 and a half she laughed at me for never kissing anyone.At 13 she laughed at be for being ugly.At 13 and a half she laughed as she stole my only friend.At 14 she laughed at me because Albus stole my diary and they read it.At 14 and a half she laughed as I cried in potions.At 15 I laughed as the guys who used to call me ugly to get her attention call me beautiful.At 15 and a half I laughed as I got better grades.At 16 I laughed as her 'boyfriend' said I looked beautiful NOW.At 16 and a half I laughed as I made her 'boyfriend' of two years send her nudes around.At 17 I laughed as I screwed her 'boyfriend'.At 17 and a half I laughed as I sent her nudes to her parents.At 18 I laughed as all her friends became mine and she found out about the "quality time" me and her boyfriend spent together.At 18 and a half I cried when her mom found her hanging from the ceiling because it was expected of me.At 25 I cry because I still don't miss her and I wish I could.Please read and review, thanks for reading.
