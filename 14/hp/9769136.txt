FrankDisclaimer: I am not J.K. Rowling. Therefore I do not own Harry Potter.Pain lances through me.She looms down over my body-not quite a corpse, I'm still struggling to hold onto the precious thing that is life."Tell me!" she hisses, teeth bared, an insane glint in her eyes.I say nothing, instead biting the inside of my cheek to keep from screaming as the next wave of Cruciatus sweeps through me.Is this what it feels like to burn? No, I decide. This is much worse.I bite clean through my cheek, leaving my mouth bloody and hurting."Tell me!" she demands again, and I shake my head again."I know that you know where he is!" she screams at me, slapping my face-hard, very hard. I think I might be missing a molar or two now.I won't tell her. I won't tell her where he is.She can't know. I won't tell her.I must protect my son.And with that thought, Frank Longbottom passed into insanity, his son Neville hidden under the stairs, surrounded by layered Silencing charms and protective wards.It's a pity that Bellatrix was talking about her precious Lord Voldemort.
