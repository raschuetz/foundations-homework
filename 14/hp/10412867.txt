Starting FreshThe war is over and Voldemort has been defeated. They were all given a choice. They could come back for an Eight year or move on. Hermione wanted to come back but Harry and Ron knew that they wouldn't be back. They were going to become Aurors and round up Death Eaters along with Neville. Seamus and Dean thought about coming back. Luna and Ginny had too. It would be their Seventh Year. McGonagall has taken on the role of Headmistress while still being head of Gryffindor as well as Transfiguration teacher.Most are trying to move on and forget about what happened. Harry meets his god-son for the first time and Andy is thrilled to have someone to help her. It is hard to move on when all you can think about is the ones that you lost. Someone is about to come back that they thought was dead. Severus Snape thought that his work was done. He did all that he could but life has a way of throwing you a curve ball. Severus is alive and kicking. Now he isn't sure what to do with his life. Teaching is out unless Potter told McGonagall.Minerva was morning the loss of so many. Severus was one of them when she found out what he did. Now that she knows that he is alive what is she going to do? He wasn't the best teacher but she feels that he could take up Potions or Defense against the Dark Arts again.
