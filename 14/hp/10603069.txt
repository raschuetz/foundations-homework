A/N: when words are in italics the other person is speaking.CHAPTER 1:PHILIP'S POV:Our Grandparents are Neville and Luna Longbottom, and all our lives we heard about how Harry Potter defeated Voldemort. They say the world is very different now from when they went to their school. Grandma said that not long after the legendary Harry killed Voldemort, the world grew darker. The ministry of magic started to hunt down any one with ties to the dark side. They killed them off like pests. After they murdered the ones they could catch, all hell broke loss.Granddad said that there was a school for people like us, but the ministry destroyed it so there would not be a relapse of evil. The ministry also started to kill off people who were related to the death eaters. They killed you if you had the same eye color or nose shape or even same freakin' shoes. The only way to avoid getting slaughtered is if you are in the ministry, you know people who are up high in the ministry, you could pay for your life, or you are muggle. Our family got away from the wizarding world. We hide trying to fit in with the muggles around us. We do still practice magic at home, but when we go to school it is difficult to not glitch out.The only other Wizard family who lived near us is the Malfoys. It was only a mom, a dad, and a son. Unlike us, we have our Granddad and Grandma with us and only our mother. Our dad died when we were only a week old. Sam (my sister) and I would hang out with Henry (the Malfoy kid) and my grandparents would give us all magic lessons. Henry was real a great friend. Once I found out about who his grandparents were and didn't want to hang out with him anymore. When Granddad asked why I wasn't playing with them. I told him what I found out. He just sat down one the couch and started laughing. "I doesn't matter what your family is like. All that matters is how you. Now remember that, and go and play with Henry." He said and smiled. I have never forgot it since
