Lucy...(I want you to know)It pricks like a thistle. Or how you'd imagine a thistle to be, considering you've never actually seen one. But over time it develops into this long, slow ache burning inside of you - rage, lust, just general insecurity(you're good at feeling that, aren't you?)And when they kiss, it's like you're being held underwater. Drowning, drowning, suffocating.He smells of lemonade and apples, while she is all sugar and peaches. Happy, bright, glowing. Yellow. You're that dull, sullen grey in the corner - not even an ice queen, more like 'frosty bitch.'It feels like a dozen mosquito stings (wouldn't that kill you?) except you're too trapped inside your own little world to see the one outside you.Tastes like broken glass in your mouth, that's if daddy ever let you go near it. For fear of 'cutting yourself' on it's edge. Of you bleeding. He'll ban scissors next, won't he?Doesn't he know that you're already scarred?(in different ways, oh so different ways)Cling, cling, cling onto the ghosts of the past, Lucy, to the boy who will never love you back (not in a million starlit years) because it's all you have left, all that you can manage to piece together now, after everything else is gone, everything else left you.It's as if you've ceased to exist.(maybe you have)You don't deserve him. You don't even deserve to want him.I don't own Harry Potter, the cover image or You Oughta Know.
