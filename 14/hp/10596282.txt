25 July 1975Dear Sirius,You showed up at my house last night; you were in a bad way. We had to take you to St. Mungo's! I hope you can come home soon.It sucks; Mum won't let me visit you! You'll laugh when you read this, but I'm kind of worried. I was scared when you showed up all beat up like that. But Mum's gonna take good care of you!It's so boring around the Manor, even more so since I can't mirror you like before. Why didn't you tell me it was so bad over there? I'd've broken you out a long time ago! Come to think of it, how did you hide it from me, anyway? I'm good at figuring out secrets! I figured out Remmy's (before you say that was a stroke of luck and we figured it out at the same time, I had suspicions before that)! You must be really good at this secret keeping stuff, mate.Mum says I have to tell the other Marauders what happened. I'm gonna finish this letter first. Remus and Peter are gonna freak! Ten galleons on Rem flooing over here as soon as he gets my owl. Haha!I hope you get out soon I know how much you hate hospitals, Padfoot. I also hope Mum will let me visit you soon. I really don't want you to wake up without someone familiar there! Get well soon, Sirius!Your best friend,ProngsA/N: Hey everybody! This plot bunny hit me and I just had to write it. The chapters will be short, as they are in letter format, but it'll be fun to write in my freetime and such. :D Hope you like!I don't own HP.
