This AU kind of just came to me when i made my Dramione gifset on tumblr. Enjoy!Draco watched as Granger's arm shot out like a bullet, excited to answer Professor Slughorn's question. He snorted, and noted that no one else had even attempted to answer any thing. Granger was Granger after all. A flash of pain spiked through his head, "Blasted firewhiskey." he thought, as he rubbed his temples. He had been able to smuggle some into the castle and almost drank the lot of it the previous night. Times were troubling and stress was not something Draco was accustomed to.He glanced up at Granger, who was still answering Slughorn she hadn't looked at him since last night, and it was unsettling. Was she ignoring him? Was she pretending that nothing had happened? Was she upset? Angry? Satiated? Draco grew more and more frustrated with each question. DAMMIT. What was this girl thinking?
