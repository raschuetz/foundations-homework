*~* Prolouge *~*Jacqueline or Jack, had been stuck in a Young Offenders Institution since the young age of 11.The reason. She was a thief.And just to make that better, she was also a witch.A witch who happened to be the daughter of Molly and Arthur Weasley and also the sister of Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred, George, Ron and Ginny Weasley.She was the twin sister of the sixth and final brother, Ron.When Jack was 9 she would sneak into muggle (non magic folk) shops and snatch whatever she could; sweets, chocolate, an apple, a can of coke.Anything really, she didn't mind whatever it was, it gave her a rush.Pure adrenaline and an excited buzz.That was enough for her until she got a little older, then she started to steal bigger things and pickpocket people when they weren't looking. Or so she thought.The Minister of Magic has spies everywhere and soon caught wind of this. It was brushed away because of her age and every third Friday, her would sit down with her in his office and talk to her about what she was doing.It worked for a while but she still stole and even more frequently, ignoring the warnings.Her parents disciplined her more, but her older twin brothers, Fred and George, had a soft spot for her and her trouble making ways.So they would break her out of her room and let sneak her out of the house so that she could cause more trouble for the dumb muggles.What they didn't realize, was that she'd been reported to the muggle police and caught on CCTV cameras all over the village shops.The muggles sent her to Juvenile Detention for it and because of all the warnings, the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, didn't do anything to get her out.So she didn't go with her twin brother on their first day of Hogwarts, she was stuck in a cell with a bunch of other teenage girls in cells surrounding hers.Fortunately, she had already got all her supplies for school and her wand; 11" Mahogany Dragon Heartstring. Every week for two hours since she was put in there, a teacher from Hogwarts would visit her and give her a lesson on magic, whether it was Charms, Transfiguration or Defense Against the Dark Arts. Her favourite spell being the Patronus Charm because hers was a proud lioness.Jack had found that she had quite the knack for Herbology and she would look after the Center's gardens to pass time.Well that and also reading, working out in the yard and tattooing profanities onto herself; which her two twin older brothers could laugh about as she was being screamed at by her mother when she found out.Her family did visit her when they could, but her siblings were either; at school, working or in another country entirely.Meaning she got a visit from family at least once a month, her mum was her main visitor, after her eldest brother Bill. Who would visit wherever he wasn't dealing with bossy goblins at Gringotts bank.Unsurprisingly, her favourite siblings visited the most, while the annoying siblings visited the least (with the exception of Charlie who was always in Romania and visited maybe twice a year.)Her favourite being Bill, Fred and George, Ron, Ginny and then her least favourite being Percy, who had his head stuck so far up his own ass that his nose could probably touch his lungs.Jack, had the signature Weasley look.Red hair.Her wavy red mane, worked with her faint scattering of freckles on her lightly sun tanned skin and her pale acid green/ambers eyes.Due to all of the gardening and working out she had a lean muscular 5'4" physique, her stomach was toned flat abs and her chest was large like her mothers. Meaning that she couldn't wear the top half of her orange jumpsuit and had to stick to large white vests.Jack Weasley was now 14 years old.Today, after three/four years in lock up, Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts and one of her more frequent visitors, had managed to 'convince' the warden to finalize her release; seeing as she got over her constant stealing addiction.Just in time for the Quidditch World Cup and just in time for her first year at Hogwarts as a fourth year.Jacqueline Cedrella Weasley was getting out and she could finally move from room to room, without the binds of silver shackles or heavily muscled macho women watching her with hawk eyes.
