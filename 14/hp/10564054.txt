It was from Dumbledore.dear Harry,I hope you are well when this letter reaches you. I have decided that for your safety you can't correspond with any one this summer. I am sorry for this but safety first. Now that that unpleasant business is behind us I am here to remind you that you are not allowed to use magic during the summer. I know your relatives are a bit unpleasant but you should be fine. I will be there to pick you up on the twenty fifth of August. At oh let's say nine o'clock. The weaslys had invited you to the world cup but I declined on your behalf. It is simply to dangerous. What if the death eaters where to attack. You will be happy to know that our mutual friend has gotten away safely. That is all yours,Albus Percival wolvric Brian Dumbledore Harry's hands shook as he gripped the letter in his hand.
