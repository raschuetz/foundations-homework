His life flashed before his eyes as the blood flowed from his wounds.Born into an unloving household he quickly learned the pattern. Stay out of the way or get punished.His father was a drunk and enjoyed exercising his belt.His mother too consumed with her own demons, her own fear to care about the life she had created, looked out for herself only.He soon had to learn to take care of himself, often killing the rats he found in the basement for food.Food was not kept in their house, mother preferring to spend he little amount of money they had on fathers liquor.He had stolen clothes from his neighbors washing line. They were much to big for him, they resembled a smock.He spent his time in the neighborhood parks and one day he noticed her.The most beautiful creature he had ever seen.To him she was an Angel, her red hair glowed gold as it caught the suns rays.She had transformed his life and finally came the time when he could escape his tragic home.But Hogwarts as not all that he had thought it would be.He lost her, he knew they were too different. That he was not good enough.He also faced further ridicule on a daily basis. The other students mocked him, made fun of his appearance and sullen attitude.but they did not know, the could not comprehend how it had been.the greasy haired boy became more withdrawn and invisible than ever.He threw himself into his studies determined to became the best. But he was always good but only good. He felt as if he could never out do his fellow students.His world became blacker than ever.Then he noticed him.He whispered words into his ear, words of greatness, of recognition.Blindly he followed.And that bought him down this path to his death.Much had changed but so much had not.Still ridiculed, still unimportant, still dominated.Maybe, he thought with his last breath, freedom will come with death.He closed his eyes, free at last.
