Katherine Rose-TylerChapter One: the IntroductionWritten By: Arie1Word Count: 2,736Edited: I have recently (as of the 13.06.14) began to rewrite this story in third person point of view, I hope it isn't too confusing for everyone, but I think that this story will be a lot more efficient once I have finished editing.Notes: Katherine Rose-Tyler is my very first attempt at writing fan fiction and I hope you enjoy the story I have to tell as much as I have enjoyed writing it. I'm open to your thoughts and opinions though I won't badger you readers to review if you don't want too.*For those who have not read this story yet, I should probably mention a few things. My OC will not be romantically involved with either Harry or Ronald, this is not my intention. I try very hard to write her as perfectly yet imperfectly as possible, she is no Mary-Sue and I really do hope I am not writing her that way. I will be re-writing the each harry potter book and I plan on writing a sequel for when those books end. I edit and write this story solely on my own but that does not mean I am uninterested in Beta's if one was to ever want to edit this story. Katherine has long black hair she never wears down and piercing blue eyes, I can't give you a face claim as I can't pick anyone I know of that fits what I have imagined*Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter, though I really wish I did.-0-Katherine Rose-Tyler was tapping her foot rather impatiently as the dirty dishes that sat on the long table in front of her disappeared. It was times like these that Katherine herself knew that wizards and witches alike would be absolutely hopeless without the help of house elves or magic to do their hard work for them. Just imagining some of the people she knew washing those dirty dishes by hand without the help of magic or house elves was enough to make her laugh.Seated across from her sat Severus Snape, his head was buried in a book he had already read before and his bowl of half-eaten porridge was pushed off to the side. He needs to start eating more, Katherine thought, as under those billowing black robes he was never seen without Severus was on the thinner side of the track. Then again he had always been like this, Katherine couldn't ever remember a time where Severus Snape was any different than how he was now.As if he had read her thoughts, Severus suddenly looked up from his book he was reading and met Katherine's ocean blue eyes; his brow was raised slightly in annoyance"You're staring, again" he stated"Really" Katherine asked "I wasn't aware, I apologies""Your letter will come soon" He continued "You just have to be-""Severus if you say patience I think I might cry" Katherine interrupted him, fiddling with her hands as she did so "You know as well as I do that I am a very patient person, it is one of my forte's, but I already had to wait an extra year due to my birthdate and my patience it seems is starting to run very thin"Severus Snape smirked at his God Daughters words before picking up where he had left off in his book."Why don't you go visit Draco?" he suggested, eyes not leaving the page of the book"He's coming over later on today" replied Katherine.In a couple of hours the young Malfoy heir would be knocking down Katherine's door to drag her outside to play Quidditch in the backyard. Draco and Katherine do almost everything together but atop that list was flying, Katherine loved flying and she loved it more than anything in the world, she would fly all day and all night if she was able too.Katherine rose from her seat and walked upstairs to her bedroom, it hadn't changed over the years that she had lived their apart from the small single sleeper being upgraded to a larger one that could spaciously fit three, the same canary yellow was splashed across the walls and pretty white laced curtains hung against the windows. A regal white wardrobe sat against a wall and held a few robes and plain items of clothing, Katherine dressed as plainly as possible as she didn't find excitement in dressing up in flashy and expensive clothes.She didn't have a reason for changing things, she really did not. Some might say that Katherine kept her home exactly how it had been built and decorated so it would be easier to remember them, but she disagreed. She kept it the same way because she had always loved her home and had no reason to change the way it was put together, anyway she couldn't possibly forget them even if she tried, if she happened to do so the rest of the world surely wouldn't.Tempest Tyler gave Katherine his dazzling blue eyes and was one of the most famous and greatest Chasers the National English Quidditch team had ever seen according to all of the magazines and books let alone the fans of not only his team but many others as well. He was as fast as lighting, strong, resilient and mazing at what he did in every sense of the word.Emma Rose is one of the most beautiful witches the Wizarding World has ever seen and even after her death people are still complementing and praising that beauty she had held. To this day she has still sold more records than any other witch or wizard in the music industry.Katherine often wondered if the Wizarding World expected such greatness from her one day.The fact was, Katherine was convinced she would never be as beautiful as her mother in her wildest dreams or as talented as her father once was on a broomstick. She didn't have a problem with that as long as she had some parts of her parents inside of her that shone through on occasion.Right now Katherine wasn't worried about that, right now she had found herself extremely bored, waiting for her best friend to arrive and impatiently waiting for her infamous letter that honestly couldn't come soon enough.For as long as she could remember she had been told about Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry by Severus or Draco's parents Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy. Katherine had read all of the books she could get her hands on and then some more, knowing that this was her year, that it was nearly time for her to attend the school had her more excited than she had ever been in her entire life.Being born in the middle of September like Katherine was she couldn't attend Hogwarts the year she turned eleven as it was too late into the year, by the time enrolment had come around she was still ten and missed her chance."Uncle said I would find you up here moping" A voice drawled, Katherine looked to her bedroom door to see Draco Malfoy leaning against the door frame with his arms crossed over his chest, looking as smug as ever. His trademark platinum blonde hair was slicked back so it was out of his face and dressed in what could only be the most fine black robes galleons could buy."I am not moping" Katherine grinned "I'm bored""Is there even a difference when it comes to you?" asked DracoKatherine shook her head and jumped to her feet, making sure to bump into Draco slightly as she walked past him on her way to collect her father's old broomstick"You're just jealous of my skills on a broom Draco" she teased lightly"You wish that were true Tyler""Oh really, if I recall I scored most last time-""And you know I'm better seeker than a chaser" he interrupted"Still, I won" Katherine said, seizing her father's old broomstick from the wall it had been mounted on "And the time before that if I remember correctly as well""As I said, I'm better at seeking Tyler" Draco scowled, she looked over her shoulder and laughed at the face he was now pulling "If we were chasing after the snitch instead of the Quaffle I'd have shown you who's best""Don't be such a sour-gnome Draco you know I'm only teasing, it's fun to rile you up over something so silly"At her words he huffed and shook his head clear of his previous expression."Just wait until we're both on the Quidditch team Kath, we'll be Slytherin team legends before we even graduate I bet and I'll make captain surely by my fifth year" he drawled proudly, mounting his broom and flying off into the clear, cloudless July skies.It was times like these Katherine suddenly felt awkward and didn't bother replying to her oldest friend.Draco Malfoy comes from a long family line of Slytherin's, Katherine's own father was in the Slytherin house but her mother was also a Gryffindor and so was her entire family. Katherine could be sorted into either house depending on what is going to happen at the upcoming sorting ceremony.Severus always snorts with silent laughter every time Katherine brings up the subject and says the exact same thing every single time. 'That'll be the day when you're sorted into anything that isn't bloody Gryffindor' he says.Katherine would talk to Draco about her fears of being sorted into Gryffindor but she's scared as to what he'll say in return, let alone what he'd actually do if she were to be sorted into that house in the future. She had known Draco her entire life, for as long as she could remember and by this point in time she knew him inside and out. This was why Katherine honestly didn't know how he would suddenly treat her if she was sorted into Gryffindor as it went unsaid that Slytherin and Gryffindor students are natural born enemies and opposing houses."What are you waiting for Tyler?" Draco bellowed from above.She glanced up, squinting into the sunlight"It's okay, if I were you I'd be scared too!" He laughed.After hearing that Katherine laughed, mounted her broom and flew into the bright sky and after the blonde headed boy."That'll be the day Malfoy!" She yelled, quickly flying past him and rolling into a dive.Katherine had never experiences anything better than the feeling she had when she was flying on a broomstick and she didn't think she ever would, because nothing could beat flying. The wind in your face, the exhilaration when you're flying higher and higher towards those three goals  everything about flying was perfect to Katherine. She even thought flying in windy, rainy or stormy weather was great.Draco and Katherine were up in the air for hours, flying around on their broomsticks and attempting at playing whatever they could with just the two of them. They spent most of their days like this now they were allowed to fly their broomsticks on their own, around the pitch in the back of Katherine's house and growing more and more confident as each day went past - not that Draco needed any more confidence than he already had."I saw Theo yesterday" Said Draco"Theo? Theodor Nott? I haven't seen him in about a year; he was rather small with the neat black hair right?" Katherine asked "We kind of lost touch didn't we, do you have any idea what happened?""I don't know" he replied, sitting down on the sofa in the sitting room "He didn't' say much about what had been happening in the past year but Father said something about his mother passing away, most of the time it was just me talking-""Not that that isn't surprising at all" Katherine grinned, taking a seat on the opposite end of the sofa "The day when you're not the one talking I'll wake up and hatch a dragon egg"He glared at her from the opposite end of the seat and crossed his arms"You know-""I know""-there will be a day that you don't interrupt me and I'll be the one hatching dragons eggs""That will be the day Draco, it really will" She smiledKatherine had a bad habit of interrupting people, something that she found she could never really help. Severus stopped getting annoyed with it years ago though it still agitates Draco to no end."Mother wanted me home half an hour ago" he said "I should be going""But you're going to stay here and keep me company so I don't go out of my mind with boredom right" said Katherine, looking at the blonde boy hopefully though he just shook his head and smirked in return"There you go with the interrupting again, you know I might just get sick of you one day and never come back here""Draco Malfoy that would never happen even if you tried your hardest""Whatever you think Tyler, you just keep thinking that""Oh I will as I know it's the truth" She laughed, throwing the pillow that she had been resting on at his head, she hit her mark thereby ruining his neat hair and it now stood up in all directions causing her to laugh even more."You're going to pay for that Tyler" he said, Katherine readied herself for a retaliation attack but instead Draco just stood to his feet, fixed his untidy hair and walked around a little table and towards the fireplace."Wait!-" She began"Malfoy Manor" he spoke loudly and clearly with that trademark smirk he wore more often than not, the next thing Katherine knew he had disappeared into the green flames that had become of the floo powder."That little-" But Katherine stopped herself short, there was no need to start talking to herself on top of everything else, she couldn't possibly be that bored yet.The idea of writing a letter to Theo Nott suddenly crossed her mind, Katherine didn't know many other children apart from Draco, not many at all so the idea was a rather appealing one.She raced upstairs and into her bedroom, sitting in the chair that stood near her desk which was already over-flowing with spare pieces of parchment and books that had already been read countless times before. She finally found a piece that hadn't been ripped or torn like most of the others and began to think about how she could possibly start to write her letter.Theo Draco was just over visiting my house visiting and told me that he had recently seen you; it has been so long so I thought I would send you a letter asking how things have been. I think it's been nearly a year now since we last saw each other and I apologies for not sending a letter or speaking to you sooner, I hope it doesn't seem like I have forgotten you or anything. We'll be going to Hogwarts soon! Isn't that exciting? I'm growing more impatient every single day because my letter hasn't come yet and that's saying something as I am normally quite a patient person. Words can't describe how much I'm looking forward to September First when we're all on that train. We should see each other before school starts though, Draco can come along as well if he wishes or better yet we could go and purchase our school supplies together, that could be fun. I look forward to hearing from you, best of wishes. Katherine Rose-Tyler She called for Zeus, Severus's owl and sent him off immediately with the letter tied tightly around his leg, she hoped that she would receive a reply sooner rather than later.Katherine glanced around her room and notices a new pile of books that had been stacked at the food of her bed, she walked over to examine them and realized that she hadn't read any of them and that they were all about the art of potion making, the subject she was looking forward most too. Katherine smiled to herself, Severus doesn't talk much and it's overly obvious to her now that she was older that Severus had no idea how to raise a child when she was younger but he had surely learnt a thing or two seeing as he knew exactly what she needed when she was bored.-0-Katherine Indeed it has been quite a while; you do not need to apologies as you're not at fault, neither of us are, it seems that time had just flown away from us. I am also growing more excited as the days drawn year, September can't come soon enough I agree. That sounds fine, owl me whenever you have the spare time. -Theo Theo Nott wrote in a beautiful script that Katherine couldn't even dream of being able to accomplish, for a couple of minutes after she had finished reading the reply she had just been sitting in her seat and running her fingers over the dried ink."Not Draco seeing as whenever he wants to talk to you he floo's in, definitely not the Hogwarts letter as it is still too soon and you have no other friends-" Katherine scrunched her brows at Severus's words"-my curiosity has spiked, I must admit""I have other friends" She said, placing the letter down onto the table"Name one" he smirked"Theo Nott" She grinned "He's my friend""Ah, so the letter is from Nott. If I am not mistaken his mother recently passed""Yes, that's what Draco told me" said Katherine "Though he didn't say how""If you needed to know, I'm sure you'd know by now" Severus said, taking to his feet and heading towards the door "Curiosity killed the cat"
