Three and a half years had passed since Alice was placed into her coma. Since then Lord Voldemort had disappeared, said to be defeated by Harry Potter. Unfortunately the poor boy had lost his parents as well on halloween night. Of course even after the war, Lucius and his family still looked after their old friend. But they had not expected her to wake up mid-summer.###########################################################################################Alice was not sure how long she had spent wandering in her own mental Wonderland, but she did have a lot of fun doing it. Battles with the Dragon Ball Z characters, adventures with the Doctor, domination with Loki, uncharted planets with the Enterprise, experiencing her own American Horror Story, and any version of Alice in Wonderland character popping up. But she knew it couldn't last, eventually she had to wake up and return to reality. Something she did not want to do, but had to. She walked through the now familiar woods, curious as to how she would leave. There was a snap of a twig right behind her, causing her to turn violently. Behind her stood the one and only Dr Jonathan Crane, and Dr Oliver Thredson. Alice smiled at the side of them, glad someone familiar was near. "So, my two favorite masked doctors came to see me off? I feel loved" she commented. "Well, all doctors must make sure their patients are in full health before sending them off" Jonathan told her."That's rich, coming from you!" Alice laughed, "Although I wish I had gotten to see more experiments. And more of your furniture, Oliver."Oliver scratched his head a bit, looking away slightly. "You know, you were never going to become like one of them right?" he asked."Yeah I kinda figured. But I will come back someday" she told them."How?" "Well i gotta die eventually. I can only hope that the afterlife is something like this."It was silent for a moment before Alice rushed over and hugged them both. She was honestly going to miss them. Giving Jonathan the nod that she was ready, Oliver wrapped her in a backwards hug as a needle full of his fear gas was injected. That's when her vision began to go funny.##########################################################################################Lucius and Narcissa were sitting in Lucius' personal office when the wards to Alice's room went off. They were only supposed to go off if there was a dramatic change in something.Standing quickly, they rushed to the room, hoping that everything was alright. When they arrived, they didn't expect to see Alice sitting on the bed, head between her hands."Alice?" Lucius asked, causing her to look up with a smirk."Hello Lucy. How long have I been out?"###########################################################################Sorry it's short, but it gets it going. Hope you enjoy!
