Certain Moments: Prologue"I could have. What does this phrase mean? At any given moment in our lives, there are certain things that could have happened, but didn't. The magic moments go unrecognized and then, suddenly, the hand of destiny changes everything."-Paulo CoelhoI don't believe in coincidences. I don't believe in luck. I don't believe in love at first sight or 'The One'. I don't believe in the supernatural, beyond those things I have experienced for myself. My least favorite subject in school was Divination because I was pretty sure it was a load of shit. But I do believe, I will always believe, in certain moments.They are periods of time that everyone every man, woman, and child on this earth experiences. A moment where if you had chosen one path, things would have gone entirely differently. They're life-changing. That fragile moment when you're at a crossroads, when you unknowingly make one small decision that impacts your entire life, is what I like to call a certain moment.I've experienced tons of them, I can recount all of the ones that lead me to her. But, you see, that's the thing about these certain moments. The thing that makes them really, incredibly special They're fragile, much like the delicately woven web of a spider. You aren't aware when they're being intricately created. They can appear as tangles at first glance, until you shift your view and you see the true complexity of it. Most people don't pay them any attentionthey're fleeting, you see until they've been flung away into the past and are completely unreachable, isolated, and alone once more. They leave quickly, before they're noticed, and leave you to attempt to fix the irreparable damage they sometimes make. These certain moments hide in the past, only to be seen and recognized for what they truly are in memories.
