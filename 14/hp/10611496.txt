I do not own Harry Potter. No, I am not JK Rowling. If I was, Snape would be Harry's dad, like in this fanfic.Hey guys! I have a very bittersweet father-son one-shot here, that would possibly be able to work with the real plot, as well! Here it is.Kiss it Better?The frail five year old lay, shuddering on a hospital bed. "Wh-where-" He broke off with a bout of coughs, then gasps for air."We're at St. Mungo's. They'll make you feel better." Harry nodded weakly at Severus' comforting words as his father sat next to him, choking back sad sobs."D-don't cr-cry. P-plea-" he broke off again to cough as he shuddered, clutching at his chest wound. Severus finally broke as he watched Harry grab at his chest. He cried out as he watched his son, dying and Harry didn't even know it.Harry looked blank for a moment.Harry was crying as he held on to his arm, running over to Lily. He held out his arm with the small cut."Kiss it better?" And Lily leaned forwards, with a 'mwah!' As her lips touched the cut that wasn't even bleeding. Harry abruptly stopped crying and instead giggled, running off to play.Harry's eyes filled with life again , and Snape let out a breath he didn't know he was holding. Truth be told, Lily was simply staying at the Potter's with Harry for the night, as Harry wanted to see his godfather, "Pwongs!" Then Voldemort came, seeking vengeance, and Snape was alone in this world. He thought he was. But it turns out he'd be with Harry.And now he'd be completely alone.He was broken out of his thoughts as Harry grabbed for the arm on his robes."Kiss..it.. Bet-better?" And Snape didn't hesitate, leaning over to kiss his son's chest. There was no 'mwah!' But Harry was still happy with it."Thank..you." The tiny boy shuddered, and with a smile and a peaceful look, he closed his eyes forever.
