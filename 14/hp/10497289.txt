Waiting with your brothers as they shop for new Hogwarts robes is no fun task. Ginny Weasley sat on a chair in the corner, glancing every few minutes at her pocket watch, waiting for the time to be right. After what seemed like forever, Ginny hopped out of her chair and called to her mother, "Mum! I'm going down to erm Flourish & Blotts to uh look for my school books!""All right, dear!" came the reply. Ginny could tell by the light tone of her mother's voice that Mrs. Weasley had no idea what her daughter had just said.As the door of the shop closed behind her, Ginny heard her mother's impatient shriek, "FRED, YOU WILL TRY THESE ROBES ON OR SO HELP ME-"Ginny couldn't help but smirk to herself as she strode down the street towards Knockturn Alley, eager to meet her mentor and her boyfriend. She glanced cautiously over her shoulder every few seconds to makes certain that she wasn't being followed."Ginny!" she heard a familiar voice call from behind her. She winced and turned around to see Nymphadora Tonks beaming at her, hurrying to catch up."Oh, hey, Tonks," Ginny said with a nervous glance at her pocket watch, "Listen, I really ought to go and find my books-""I'll come with you!"Ginny thought about Tonks's proposal and decided that there would be no unsuspicious way to refuse her offer. "Alright, thanks, then"
