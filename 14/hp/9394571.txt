Hogwarts, Hogwarts, hoggy warty Hogwarts!Teach us something please,Whether we be old and bald,Or young with scabby knees,Our heads could do with filling,With some interesting stuff,For now they're bare and full of air,Dead flies and bits of fluff,So teach us things worth knowingBring back what we've forgot,Just do your best, we'll do the rest,And learn until our brains ALL ROT!"A round of applause for Hogwarts very own Marauders for leading this year's rendition of the school song along with their very entertaining dance. I half fancied a jig myself had our esteemed deputy headmistress not given me a stern talking to."Headmaster Dumbledore's blue eyes twinkled brightly despite his age as he was mock-saluted by two of the infamous prankster group, Messrs Potter and Black. They then bowed deeply to the wild crowd of their peers before jumping off the Gryffindor table to rejoin their other two amused friends."One last announcement before we enjoy our welcoming feast. For the first time in almost two centuries, Hogwarts has a transfer student."Immediately whispers started but Dumbledore held up his hand and the hall quieted."Please welcome Miss Hermione Granger."Something a bit more light hearted and not quite as heavy plotted as my other stories that I can play with before I drive myself insane with how things are suppose to go. Please review though!Your reviews channel my imagination- Verdant
