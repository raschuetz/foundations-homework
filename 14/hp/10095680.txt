He looks into the eyes before him. His image is reflected back onto their red orbs. The not-man they belonged to is kneeled before him- looking up at him with one part shock and three parts resolved embrace."It was always going to end this way," Harry said."We both knew it would," replied Voldemort. "Ever since that first glimpse.""That doesn't mean I wanted to finish it like this.""I know.""But the cycle must be completed. The story must have a happy ending- and you've done too much for redemption from the hero.""Should have stopped earlier." His eyes close for a moment and you can see reminisces of his old life- when he was truly alive and human. Then his eyes snapped open again with new strength shinning in them. His right eyebrow arches almost playfully. "But we both knew that wouldn't happen." Harry can't help but smirk back."Yes, we did. Didn't we?" But then all traces of a smile fell from his face and only sadness remained. Sadness that only comes from doing what you know has to be done- when all you wish for is to escape from the very destiny that drove you here."I'm sorry.""I am too."And then a green flash erupted from his phoenix wand. Voldemort was no more and the world cheered. But Harry could only think that sometimes the cycle is more than the glimpses shown in it.
