Dear fellow Writers and Bookworms,HELP ME PLEASE!I'm sorry to be this person who asks about where a particular fanfiction is because they can't find it, when all you really want to do is just skip and continue reading fanfiction.But I have to be this person for a short amount of time, until I can find this story with (hopefully) the help of those who read this.So, the details of this story contain:-Hermione didn't go to Hogwarts, she went to Beauxbaton -Fleur is Hermione's step sister-Fleur was with Harry, got pregnant, hid the baby from him and gave the baby to Hermione when Fleur's daughter was born and Fleur ran off (doing all of this with selfishness) -Hermione is a painter and looks after Fleur's daughter-Harry found out about his daughter, tracked her down, and took his daughter away. Then he gave Hermione the option of becoming his wife-Harry, Ron, Ginny, Luna and Ron are all famous and rich. Hermione, not so much- Pretty sure this is M rated. That or T rated.Again sorry to bother the readers of this, but I've been searching this for a while now and couldn't get the right settings or words.Thank you to those who do help me with this by reviewing this or PM-ing me and if you are interested in Harry/Hermione with additional Ron, Dumbledore, Molly and Ginny bashing please come check out my stories.Yours truly, Little Dragon/GoldenKeeper
