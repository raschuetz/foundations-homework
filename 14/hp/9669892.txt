A/N: I realise this is confusing. I know. I'm aware this probably won't be very appreciated or you know, reviewed fic, but hey, I feel like publishing it anyway.i. LilySwish, swish, swish  red hair like roses, like blood, like fire. You are falling, floating, twisting. Spider webs on your skin, zigzagging across the pale flesh, bleeding invisible blood, screaming in visible pain. Biting your lips, cutting your skin, you bleed, bleed and bleed. Your wings flutter  loudly, widely, and try to brush away the pain. Dark eyes like dying coals, glinting in the light, but ultimately fading. You're just a ghost, trapped spirit in a physical body, pushing up at those boundaries, sometimes nearly breaking free.It is dark when you feel alive. The shadows brush against you, curling around your wrists, hiding the scars. It is dark when you see him, and your fading eyes hurt as he shines, shines and shines, like a star fallen to the ground. He sees you, even as you fade into the background of dark material. He smiles and it is bright, and it is sharp and beautiful like diamonds. You wonder if someone has tried to kill for one of his smiles, and darkly you think, that maybe you will.He does not seem to see or feel the shield of darkness around your body, the one that pushes even your own flesh and blood away. He does not stop until he is in front of you and you feel your skin burning at the close proximity. He is not only bright, he is warm  hot, you think, feeling your skin prickle. Hot and cold collide in a hurricane, and your story spirals wildly, downhill, from there.to be continued.To Ana, who said she enjoys obscure work. This is probably as obscure and incomprehensible as I can get, and I hope you enjoy it.Love you, girl!
