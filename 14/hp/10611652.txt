Do you ever think about your life and realize it's not worth living? Because I do, every single day. It was my father who taught me how to read. At the age of three, he gave me my first book. The tales of Beedle the Bard. It's one of my most beloved books. It's my security book. Every time I'm feeling worse than I usually do, I read my security book and all of a sudden, I'm just feeling bad, not worse than bad. It makes me think less about taking my own life and more about keeping the memories alive. I can't just let the memories die.I used to hope, even when I got shipped off to this horrific orphanage, that he'd still come back to me. As a child I would have very vivid dreams and daydreams, where he would come knocking at the door to Walter's Orphanage and run up the stairs to where my room is, and take me home. He would scoop me up in his arms and carry me home, and then we'd live happily ever after. Stupid dreams made up by the imagination of a stupid child.But I am no longer a child. Life made me grow up.As I got to the age of eight and nine, just two and three years ago, I matured quite a lot when one of the kids at the orphanage taunted me and teased me about how no one loved me, and how no one would never adopt me. They were right though. No one did adopt me.Who would want a black haired, sad girl with scars at her wrists? Exactly, no one.My own eyes were very much like my dad's, although his eyes were a darker shade of blue than mine. My eyes have a hint of dark green in them. I cannot remember anything else about my dad's appearance other that he had a dark hair color. My guess is black, because my own wavy hair is black.I don't know anything about my mother. I've never met her and I don't think I ever will. The first few months at the orphanage, when I gave up on the thought that daddy would come back, I thought that she would come and get me, but she didn't. Everybody just lets you down, don't they?
