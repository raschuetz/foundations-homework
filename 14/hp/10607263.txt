Disclaimer: I own nothing.Albus dumbledore the wisest of them all,Or so they say in the whispers of the hallDefeater of Darkness, Leader of LightOne Shadowed all hallows night,Lights flying away from the Lamps in rows,Dimming the view of the neat little housesEach the same with their neat little gardenNot a single imperfection in sight but oneThe wise man walked down the coal black streetSilent but for the swaying of his robes and the clicking of his bootsHe stopped at the door with the number fourproudly proclaimed against the snow white paintA cat from across the street came towards the manThe cat morphed into a womanWith strict lines forming across her faceNot soon after a rumble in the silent night could be heardA giant of a man came in to the light off of his rideCarrying a bundle that was the size of his handCrying all the wayThe Wise man took the bundle from the GiantWhile woman shushed the Giant as not to wake the unknowingThe bundle flap opened to show a sleeping babeWith a lightning scar on his fore headThe babe opened his eyes to show eyes of EmeraldThe man spelled the child to the land of sleepPlacing him just in front of the door of No.4The woman frowned at the wise man saying he was a HeroThat these people were no goodThey would never understand himThe wise man ignored her pleasAns placed a single letter on top of the sleeping babeLeaving with his companionsNot knowing In Less than ten yearsThe boy who he hoped would be their saviourWould leave them to their fates.Because as Wise as Albus Dumbledore may beThe wise are blind to their faults in their plansAs are those who idolised himSo they never thought of protecting him from attacks from the inside.And that is why it can be said that the wise are wise from experienceBut they need to be fools to act rashlySo The Wise are fools, fools that sealed their own fate.
