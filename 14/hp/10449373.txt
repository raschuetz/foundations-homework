Hey fellow readers, writers, and authors of fanfic!It's DetectiveFox here with a small announcement.With the coming update of Chapter 5 for my first story, Rise of the Night Sky, I would like to thank everyone who have reviewed, favorite, and alerted my story.Also a BIG thank you for helping me reach my goal of over 100 reviews in just four chapters. Thank you all so much!So for that, I'm putting this up.It isn't a story per say. But rather a set of fanfiction ideas, whether they be full-long stories or single one-shots, that I will be making into real stories later in the future if they sound good enough.I felt I need to write them down while they were still there in my mind.But they won't be made into full stories until I'm a good way through with my crossover story. The reason being, if I put a new story up, I may lose focus in my first story.So the main base of these ideas are Harry Potter-style stories, though some will be crossovers while others will contain certain elements from other shows or books.Each chapter would be the very first chapter of the storyin other words the prologue. Plus if you've seen my chapters as of late, you will all know I like to write long chapters for you all to read.If it's a one-shot idea, then we will show a good chunk of it.But please remember that these are MY ideas. So I don't want to be looking through the web one day and find someone else has taken it for themselves.While you read them, I would like to know you opinion for each one. Like what could work slightly better and so on. Please don't comment on the spelling and grammar side, as I need to find a BETA Reader.As please don't flame me if a character you like is flamed in one chapter, don't forget each chapter is different and the personalities would be different in each one.So I hope you enjoy.
