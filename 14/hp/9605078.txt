Disclaimer: Don't own and never will.AN: Written for the Writing Scripts Boot Camp Challenge! By Uni shall not sink.Dear Daphne,After all these years of being a good little Slytherin girl, avoiding trouble and generally keeping your head down, I can't believe that you want to tour Europe in a car of all things. Especially a muggle car. What's wrong with using apparition or portkey? In fact, why do you feel the need to get away at all? It's not like we did anything wrong. We didn't join the Death Eaters and it's not like you did anything that nobody else did. I really don't get it.I suppose it could be that Gryffindork streak of yours. You did charge back into the battle against the Dark Lord, even when it looked helpless. But by some stroke of luck, you survived that and now you want to jump into a muggle death trap? There are magical cars you could take, I don't know why you want to go in a muggle one. You have to stop and talk to muggles at petrol stations and handle their money and everything!Mother and father are a bit put out as well. They think it's unseemly behaviour for a good young pureblood witch like you and I must say I agree.Well wishes,Your sister Astoria.
