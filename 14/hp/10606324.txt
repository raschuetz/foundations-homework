They run away together three weeks after the last funeral.Lee brushes her dark hair from her eyes and smiles, because really, he has nothing left. He has to fill the void inside him, and the pretty Quidditch player standing beside him will do just fine. He knows it's not fair, what he's doing. She still has people, somewhere, who need her. But Lee is selfish and today, he needs her more.Demelza smiles back and grabs his hand. She knows what he's doing. She knows he carries emptiness that he is trying to fit her into. She even knows that it won't work. Not really. Not for long. But she thinks she's better than booze at least and she loves him and he needs her. Today, Demelza is unselfish and when the vicar asks, she says;"I do."
