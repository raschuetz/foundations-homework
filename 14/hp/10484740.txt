A/N- Ok guys, bear with me for one on spelling and grammar! For two, I am American so please excuse me lack of English slang and such. I'm trying! Hope you all like the story...please let me know what you think, good or bad! Obviously this is far from canon so just roll with me on it and have some fun! Also, let me point out this is my first fanfic so please be honest so I can improve (;Chapter 1 ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````May 2, 1998...Battle of HogwartsHermione instantly saw that Fred was in trouble. The wall had exploded and he was the one in it's path. Without thinking, she launched herself at Fred, hitting him right in his soft middle with her shoulder. She felt an impact hit him in his pelvis as they were falling and then felt shattering pain in her spine and ribs just below her collarbone. After they landed in the rubble, a heavy piece of rock landed just below her knee, causing her to cry out as it broke both of her bones, drawing the attention of Death Eaters that were near. Curses started to shoot their way. "Stupefy!""Avada Kedavra!""Petrificus totalus!""Obliviate!" This was Hermione's favorite, as it was hard to remember who to curse and what the curses were when hit with this one. Fred was doing his best to cover them both but it was proving difficult when they were stranded on the ground. Harry, Ron, and Percy were near but they were trying to fight off the Death Eaters as well. "Avada Kedavra!" Percy hit Thicknesse as Rookwood took off down the corridor. Harry and Percy were finally able to pull Fred and Hermione from the rubble of the exlplosion and pull them to safety.Voldemorts voice is heard above the screams and noise, beckoning Harry to the Forbidden Forest. Percy and Ron levitate Fred and Hermione to the Great Hall where the lay with the injured, waiting on the rest of the family to see if everyone is ok."Hermione, I can't believe you saved me. I was going to die. My life literally flashed before my eyes. Then, there you were. You...you're amazing, you are.""I didn't even think to be honest...it was all just instinct. I couldn't just let you die. Not without trying to save you. You're too important." Hermione panted back to him in pain."Well you definetly saved his life. And George's, because I doubt he could have survived if his twin had died. He'll probably erect a monument in your honor." chuckled Percy, trying to lighten the mood, seeing how much pain Hermione was in. At this moment, George came running in the Great Hall, frantic. Spotting Percy and Ron, he sprinted over. Seeing Fred lying on the floor, he fell to his knees at his side."You ok, Freddie? You gonna make it?", trying to sound nonchalant."Of course I am! Although I was almost dead...we were just discussing how you were going to erect a statue in Hermione's honor for saving my arse. Even though she got the worst end of the deal for saving me. Look at her! She's in need of a bloody good healing for sure!"George gets up and gathers Hermione up in his arms to thank her, causing her to cry out in pain from her broken ribs and who knows what else. He releases her, feeling terrible. The rest of the family makes their appearance at this time, all looking quite well aside from normal cuts and bruises. As Molly and Arthur are making over Fred, Ron leans down over Hermione, puts his hand along the side of her face and puts his mouth over hers. He wiggles his tongue into her seems to go on for forever. Molly finally clears her throat and he lifts his head and Hermione can breathe again."Hermione, I can't even begin to thank you for my boys life. Percy and Fred told me what you did. And now you're so injured...I just can't..." she broke down into tears. Arthur squeezed her shoulders."Molly, it's no problem. Really. Right now, I'd appreciate it if someone could check on Harry. I think he went to the Forbidden Forest. We all need to face Voldemort together. Could someone see if Madam Pomfrey is busy with someone worse than me? If she is, I'll wait. If not, could she please help me? I'm really worried about Harry." Hermione fretted.Percy instantly volunteered,"I'll go check with Madam Pomfrey."Ron broke the news to Hermione, "Harrys been gone since we brought you and Fred in here. We can't find him." Hermione looks over and sees Madam Pomfrey heading over towards them with Percy. She knows it's going to be a long while before she's healed enoughed to be of any help to anyone, let alone Harry.
