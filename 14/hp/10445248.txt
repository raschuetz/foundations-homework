A/N: So I've seen this for other stories (most particularly my favorite, Guess the Cat by Storm-Eyes-Osprey under the Warriors fanfiction archive). But I haven't ever come across one for Harry Potter, so I'm not really sure how it will go. Please review. How it works: A riddle/poem will be presented each chapter directly regarding an unnamed character. The reader will read it and then try to guess who the poem is talking about via review. The first person to get one right will get to decide who is the next character. The character for this chapter will be announced next chapter, and so on.Punishment isn't fun.I learned this rather early onBut the deed was done.I did not hide or run.I wasn't guilty,But everyone told me my blood was filthy.I don't know if it was fairBut punishment came as a scare.Then I got a jobAmong those I love.Happiness had not been robbed.And then I met her-She was a gift from above.Our travels togetherThrough good and bad weatherMade us a part of historyAnd made a fond memory.I know it's short, and I'm not very certain how vague this actually is, but I greatly appreciate any guesses and/or review
