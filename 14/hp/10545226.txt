Disclaimer: I am not JK Rowling and therefore do not own Harry Potter.Chapter 1Mariela Diana Paredes Lujan had spent her life living in a quiet village deep in the Amazon of Peru. At almost three years old, all she knew was the clean air, trees taller than any building she had ever seen, the constant companionship of her older brothers, the warmth of her mother's hugs and the safety of her fathers arms. Everyday was filled with adventure as she and her brothers, Juan, Julian, and Jorge, frolicked in the sun, climbing trees and disturbing the wildlife. To put it simply, her life was a magical one  rather fitting as she came from a long line of witches and wizards.Author's Note: There are roughly 24 pages of this story written so far and it is far from over - I have mulled over the plot for months. This will be a drabble format, all in sequential order and in varying lengths. Updates will be sporadic. Enjoy!
