Hiyaa everyone, I'm back with a brand new story called Hermione Speaks Out. She is my favourite Harry Potter Character and she is paired with nearly every person out there. I'll be slagging off some of my favourite Hermione pairings as I know she herself would't be overly happy about them but ah well. Please enjoy the story and be nice. I do know this chapter is short but there will be lots and lots of chapters cause I'm pairing her with everyone cause it's fun. By the way pleasee don't take offence if your favourite pairings are being slated, as I do like her with nearly most of them. Disclaimer - Don't own Harry Potter or any of the characters :(Hello readers, now my name is Hermione Jane Granger, Head Girl and Gryffindor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Now I've been reading some of the some of the stories you all love to write and I have one hefty complaint. It is not about the plot as this is fascinating and original it's more along the lines of relationships you like to place me in. I'm sorry but you may have noticed the majority of people you place me with are just so obscure I couldn't even put words in a sentence to describe itSo me; Hermione Jane Granger will go through relationship after relationship from the wrong to the downright bizarre. I will talk you through all the problems the relationship would have, also the pros to the relationship as every relationship must have a few aspects that would make it work. I'm ashamed to admit it, but I do feel like I am the fan fiction whore, you have paired me up with everyone!So enough of me explaining myself and my aim for what I will be achieving today. Word of warning for all you fans, there'll be relationships you absolutely adore and I just despise so dear readers prepare for the worse. Now let us begin Please review next chapter will be up very soon.
