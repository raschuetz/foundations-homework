CHAPTER 1 Time Turner plans and the ministry for magicHarry walked down the cold street, his breath coming in clouds of mist, the morning breeze fluttered against his face as his emerald eye's moved back and forth on a piece of old parchment he had found in the school library, he began to inwardly mutter the spell for practice..every now and again a thought flitted through his head, "do you really want this?"Harry shook his head and concentrated on memorizing the spell in his hands, he sighed as he read through it again and ran a hand through his black, unruly hair, this was by far the craziest thing that he was planning to do, and he didn't want this any other way.He knew he could change things, he could right the things that had gone wrong, but he looked back, all his friendsno he kept repeating the same thought over and over in his head "I'm changing things for the best" he sighed as he found himself face to face with the out of order red phone booth which led to the ministry.He was sure that no one would be up there where he was going, at that moment a whole load of memories of the events that happened in the previous days coursed through his head, it had already been 3 years since the war and he and Hermione were going out, Ginny had fallen for another. It had been a long time since he and the gang had visited Hogwarts so they had gone to see how everyone was doing.Flashback'Mione, I'll just go up to the library and all, I want to check something up," he said quickly kissing Hermione, Hermione looked into his eyes and frowned slightly, "what's going on harry? Is something wrong?" she asked worriedly "nono nothing love" he said re-assuringly and held her close to him and pushed back her hair lightly, she sighed contently," just tell me something""mmmm?", "when did you start loving me?" he asked a bit awkwardly, she chuckled and hugged him "since second year, why?", "just wondering" he said weakly, kissing her again he turned and walked up to the almost empty library, he picked up a book from the section 'time paradox' and sat down near the window, he flipped through the pages and read a few lines.There was mainly stuff about peoples horrible mistakes in the past which they tried to cover up by going to the future and getting legal forms etc. Harry yawned and was about to replace the book when a piece of old parchment fell out, he picked it up casually and read it,'one who wishes to go back in time and live that time period again will find the necessary spell on this page'WARNING: Be careful not to do anything dramatic to change the past or you will have to live through a worse future according to your actions.'All that you know now will come with you as you merge with your past self. The following has to be used on a time turner''imensa liag manta las chanper ledre ma safen coz reverse (mention the time period you want to go back to) somermalt won si nega fal' and with a simple wrist movement (swish and flick) to be cast upon the time turner, turn the pendum twice and you will go back to the exact time you want (any time turner is suitable).Harry took a deep breath 'at the time he was facing Voldermort and felt Voldermorts spell rebound and hit Voldermort himself, he had a feeling of immense power overcome him, when he had explained this to Dumbledore, Dumbledore stated that it was wand less magic, Harry was surprised when he found out that using this magic you could destroy all the horcruxes easily, so what he intended to do now was to go back in time to save his parents. Harry had spent days working on a fool proof plan and now he was ready.Harry stepped into the phone booth and dialed six, two, four, four, two, the dial whirred and a cool female voice answered, "welcome to the ministry of magic, state your name and purpose" this was exactly as Harry remembered when him and his friends went into the department of mysteries, he shuddered, the day that Sirius died, "um.Harry Potter, time travel" he said hesitatingly and then out of the change holder a badge popped out, it read 'Harry Potter, Time Travel' "the ministry wishes you a pleasant day" said the voice and the phone booth began to descend and Harry found himself overlooking the atrium.He quickly covered himself with the invisibility cloak and snuck quietly into the lift, softly he pressed the down button and waited till the cool female voice said "department of mysteries" he quietly turned towards the plain black door and swung it open, once more he found himself in the same black room with eerier blue flames lighting it up, he cleared his throat and said "time travel" and a door opened on his right.Surprised that his plan had worked he walked into the room and saw the beautiful, dancing, diamond-sparkling light, and when his eye's finally got accustomed to the light he saw clocks gleaming from every surface, he ran up to where there were 3 time turners and grabbed one, after checking if it was in working condition he spun around and was exiting the ministry in a flash.When he was out he apparated to the burrow where they were currently residing.he looked up and saw her running towards him, she jumped into his outstretched arms and hugged him tight, "where were you?"she asked him quickly, he pecked her lightly on the cheek, "I'll explain later" he said wrapping an arm around her waist, "Harry James Potter! Don't you tell me your up to something that you obviously know won't work out!" she said accusingly, Harry sighed heavily and rolled his eyes, he knew that she would be like this."Alright, um I'm going to go back in time to save my parents and.. I was wondering if you would like to come with me." he said quickly.
