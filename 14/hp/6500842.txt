Goblet of Fire: RewriteBy Rosa241Okay so I've had this idea in my head for a while now, I always liked Percy Weasley and I really hated what J.K Rowling did to him from the fourth book onwards. Therefore I decided to rewrite them from that point onwards in my own style, although the overall plot line will remain the same the way they get there will not nessicarily remain the same, mainly because i am choosing to make both Percy Weasley and Oliver Wood one year younger than they are in the books, meaning that they are still at school in the fourth year. All other character ages reamin the same, Fred and George are just one year youner than Percy and Oliver now. I do not think that changing Percy's age changes any other details from the first three books, other than the fact that he and Oliver do not graduate in the fourth book (use your imagination please!), If it does please let me know.Disclaimer: All characters and the book belong to JK Rowling, I OWN NOTHING!Some passages have been taken directly from the book seeing as nothing much changes in this early chapter!
