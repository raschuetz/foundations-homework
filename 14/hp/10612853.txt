I am looking for a story where Harry is adopted by a demon (I think). He then goes to Hogwarts and starts his first year. Harry also becomes a Demon himself but does not become evil. I think there is a scene during the tri-wizard tournament the task are different than in canon.I think that Harry transforms into his demon to complete the tasks. This was also a HHr ship.
