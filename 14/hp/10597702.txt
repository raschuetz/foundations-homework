Hermione walked along the Black Lake, mind whirring and body aching.Work off the fat, she had thought to herself, and now, her muscles scorching and her stomach growling, she wished she could stop and find something to eat.But instead, she continued her traipse. Never before had she felt so.Depressed. It was like she was trapped within a bubble, unable to escape from her fate. Because no matter how much Hermione wanted to stop her habits, her scary, lethal habits, she couldn't.So she walked, until the pain tearing throughout her body had overridden the demons she felt inside.
