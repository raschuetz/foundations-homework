Decided to write it all as dialogue - seemed more entertaining that way.. . . . .*Thump*"Ow!""Sorry.". . . . ."Shit, Hermione, stop.""What's wrong?""Cramp! Cramp!". . . . ."Dammit, Draco. You keep jabbing me with the knob.""Umm, isn't that what I'm supposed to be doing?""Ugh! Not that knob, the gear knob.""Haha. Whoops.". . . . ."Hermione?""Yes?""Why can I hear music?""I think my foot hit the radio.""What's a no, I don't even want to know.". . . . ."Oh, god. I'm so close. Harder, Draco!"*BEEEEEEEEEEEEP*"What the fuck was that?". . . . ."If you put your leg up there""Ok.""And I twist like this""Argh.""Hmm, ok, maybe not.". . . . ."Arghhhhh.""Arghhhhh.""Finally!". . . . ."Damn stupid muggle inventions. I'm not doing that again.""Oh, come on. It wasn't that bad.""Not that bad? I was nearly impaled on that whatever that thing is.""It's called the handbrake.""I don't care what it's called. The point is: no man should ever be in danger of having one rammed up his arse! I don't care if it's one of your favourite fantasies  we're never having sex in a car again."End.
