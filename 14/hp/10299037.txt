Disclaimer: I don't own Harry Potter. Nor do I own James and Lily. Or any of JK Rowling's other characters, or world, really.PrologueOrOf Choices and Teddy BearsIt wasn't supposed to end the way it did. And we all know exactly how it ended.Had things been different, they would have lived a long, happy life together, with three children and a cat. But had things been different, they might have never fallen in love in the first place. Or maybe they would have. Maybe, because he was James Potter and she was Lily Evans and they were both proud and stubborn, maybe they had to fall in love, no matter what. Maybe it was destiny, but then again, neither of them believed in destiny. Their story is one of ups and downs, and fighting and screaming and an actual kiss in the rain, and love. And it is one of choice.You could say that their story started the day they got on that first train together, or even the day that Lily met who would end up being her best friend, or even the day they were born, but they would disagree. Lily Evans and James Potter will probably tell you it all started with a choice that involved a teddy bear.More specifically, a pink teddy bear, named Melody.A/N: This has been a long time coming.I say this is my way of getting over my addiction to The Life and Times by Jewels5 (which you should totally read) and is a semi-fanfiction on what she did, but it's mostly, you know, my own Jily fic, with my own headcanons and the way I see Jily.My friends say that I talk about Jily too much and I should have written this fic months ago. They're probably right.So I really hope you enjoy my fic, and unless this takes off like crazy (psst go read the life and times) you're welcome to message me anytime. Reviews, in the words of the amazing Jewels5, are better than sex.
