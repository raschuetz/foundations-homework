This is for Plot Bunnies. A few will be tragic, some will be funny, some will be thought-provoking: All will be my own (even if inspired by other fanfic authors).Wherever applicable, I will list the stories and authors that inspired me.Some will be clich  and I will be very open about it when I am quite certain it is clich.There will be some bashing, I am certain. The most-oft-bashed will be Dumbledore because Canon Dumbledore deserves it the most.I hereby give the disclaimer that I own nothing of Harry Potter nor any other recognized Copywritten works mentioned or Trademarks mentioned. It's under Fair Use.
