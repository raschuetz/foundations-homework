Written for Scavenger Hunt Challenge (A drabble under 200 words using the prompts restless, golden, snow)-oOo-Draco was restless as could be. Outside the windows, he watched the snowflakes fall in such an inviting manner. He wanted nothing more than to race out the door, and throw himself into the clouds of snow. He refrained though, knowing that his father would not be pleased if he were to do so. Glancing at the adults around him, the four year old only sighed and stayed rooted in his stop. He hated these parties. His father's work friends would come about, discussing business, while his mother's friends were pinch his checks and tell him how cute he was.He had to suffer through it, knowing that if he were to misstep he would have to face his father's anger. That was not something the child wished to encounter any more than he had to. So he stood there, fidgeting and watching the snow falling, but not saying a word on the subject.He was the golden child, the perfect little Malfoy heir. And he would have to stay there, patiently waiting until he could remove the stiff robes and crawl into the fresh snow.
