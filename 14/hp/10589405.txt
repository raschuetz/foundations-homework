Disclaimer: I don't own any characters, themes etc appearing in the story - they belong to J. but I'm sure you know that alreadyHarry Potter Fanfiction: Through the Years:'Lily, take Harry and run! I'll hold him off.' Those words, resounding through every part of James' being, knowing they would be the last he would speak to her. Speeding into the corridor, James' only desire was to hold him off for as long as possible. Long enough, at least, to let Lily escape. Slowly, Voldemort entered the house, hooded and covered in a black cloak. He raised his wand, those lips forming those dreaded words, and a flash of green light.Some say your whole life flashes before your eyes before you die. Some say that is utterly false. James found, however, that the best parts of his life did.I'll be updating with the next chapter soon. That was sort of just the prologue.Please do review. I love them so much, and they inspire me to write more. Really will appreciate relevant constructive criticism
