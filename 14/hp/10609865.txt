He was sitting in class with his best friends around him, he loved how they never judged him for who he loved, even if she is a muggleborn. She was beautiful with her teeth and hair, oh her hair was his favorite thing about her! How it was all frizzy and everywhere. Man, what he would do for just one night in bed with her."Mr. Malfoy, drink this immediately!" said his godfather, Draco listened only because that's what his Hermione would do. Taking a sip he finally thought properly, what in the world was he thinking! Loving a filthy mudblood, a girl no less! Nasty! Harry Potter is the only one who holds my heart.
