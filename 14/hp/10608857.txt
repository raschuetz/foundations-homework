ImperviousPrompt: Must be written in first personTo Whom it May Concern,With the war over and everyone so focused on rounding up the last of the Death Eaters, I feel I should warn you that the real trouble is much closer to home. We've become used to simply resorting straight to violence to resolveour issues, and when one is the perceived enemyFor so long there have been no real consequences of cursing a known Death Eater and even their offspringof course with young, impressionable children, this behaviour willcarry over to anyone they perceive to be evil. This translates directly to those that have an affinity for the dark arts. I didn't choose this. I didn't choose to have the entirety of Hufflepuff house shun me because of who my father was. Yes, I have an affinity for dark magic, but it was how I was born. You can't choose that, but you can choose what to do with it. The studentsmy peersdo not understand this. For too long the 'light' has been the equivalent of 'good' and 'dark', 'evil'. As each day passes, so does my will to survive. I wonder if this is the kind of world I will be faced with outside of these castle walls. I beg you, for the safety of the others that will soon be ousted, please do something about this blatant bigotry.Sincerely,Owen Cauldwell
