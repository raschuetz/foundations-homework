The RumourIt all started with Pavarti Patil and Lavender Brown. As these rumours often tend to do. Apparently the two Talky Twits had managed to get it into their absurdly thick skulls that they had heard Fay Dunbar tell Susan Bones that she heard from Terry Boot that Zacharias Smith was eavesdropping on Dean and Seamus's conversation, during which, Dean had told Seamus he overheard Pansy Parkinson and Millicent Bulstrode telling Malfoy that they had been listening when Neville had told Ernie that he had heard Ron telling Harry that he thought my handwriting was very tidy. According to the Dunderheaded Duo this meant that we are 'star crossed lovers' because they were convinced that I am secretly dating Hogwarts' very own Ultimate WingFerret. Everyone in the student population of Hogwarts with one tenth of a brain (Just me then) could see that the Albino drowned rat was being an Ultimate WingFerret by way of trying to get Ginny to notice Blaise Zabini. He was doing a great job too, by all appearances. The two were actually talking civilly. Which is quite an achievement, for a Weasley and a Slytherin. Though Ginny did not take the family prejudice as to heart as Ron did, she had been raised to never trust a Slytherin. Admittedly, I had been spending a bit of time around Malfoy, but that was ONLY because I was hanging around with Ginny (and she seemed to like talking to Zabini a lot), because Ron was being a pest. Reason: I refused to "edit" his homework. I mean, come on; it's the first week of our Fifth year, our EXAM year, surely he would've learned to work by now? Anyway, I wanted a quiet year at Hogwarts. Just one, before the War began. Once I'd nipped that astronomically unrealistic rumour firmly in the bud, that's what I intended to have. After all, there was no way I'd ever fall for Drac-Malfoy with his captivating grey eyes and toned figure I mean, his annoying existence.A/N: Please review! :)
