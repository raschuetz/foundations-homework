A/N: This was requested, don't shoot me. :0 This is in Ginny's POV. It's based on the song Amnesia by 5SOS. Mwah!I opened the door to the Gryffindor Common Room. I started to make my way up towards the girls dorms, before I could, I was hit in the arm with a small paper dragon.In its enchanted beak was an envelope which was addressed to me. I sighed and took the letter. I knew who it was from.I went up to the girls dorms and sat on my bed with the curtains of the four-poster drawn tightly shut.I opened the letter and began to read.Dear Gin, I love you. I know I probably don't have the right to say that anymore, but I love you.I love you so much Gin, I love the way that you smile and the way your eyes glimmer when you get angry I know I fucked up. I know it, believe me. I know it's my own fault you're gone. I shouldn't have done what I did.But I regret it so, so much, you have no idea. Gin, I'm so sorry. But it hurts, Gin, it hurts so goddamn much. I wish that I could forget you Gin. I really do. It sounds so cold but I do, I know there is no chance in hell we'll ever be together again. I know that.So is it really so selfish that I want to forget all the happy memories?It's been two months Gin. It doesn't feel any better.I know you've moved on and I accept that. I just don't understand how you did it.I love you Gin. Never forget that. Yours,Dean.I wiped away the tears that were streaming down my face. I began to sob, silently. If only I could take Dean back. If only.I missed Dean so much, but I don't know if I could ever look past his wrongs.I don't know how long I sat there, an hour, maybe two. But the more I sat and thought, the more it stopped hurting.A/n: OMG IT'S SO SHORT I KNOW. I didn't rreally have anything else to day soo. Deal. This was requested. :3.
