Harry could only stand at his friends side , he hadn't a word of encouragement to offer at this point-in-time.Sobbing inconsolably , Hermione craddled her fiance's corpse.Only a week ago they'd gotten engaged , now he was dead.Mrs. Weasley couldn't bare to look upon her second slain son , it was only moments ago Fred Weasley had been murdered in cold blood.The battle was raging on all around the , but time stood frozen for the two friends.Suddenly something changed , Hermione was gone leaving Mrs. Weasley and Harry distraut.Pocketing the time-tuner , Hermione glaced around the room certain something had gone tremendously wrong.Brushing off the dust from her clothing , she stepped forward to examine the unfamiliar surroundings , it seemed she was still at Hogwarts but had over-shot her intended target landing sometime in the past.Time-Travel was risky to start , she couldn't meddle in this time frame without something happening in the future.It was imperative she returned to her own time , quickly.Hermione clutched the time-turner to her chest , and started to turning it.It then occured to her , she didn't know what time-period she was in therefore couldn't possible know how far to set the time-turner to get back home.Sighing to herself , Hermione carefully stepped into the hallway.Hermione had been totally unaware of the young man , until they'd smashed into each-other sending books flying in every direction.The young wizard quickly sprang to his feet, furiously gathering his belongings together before leaving a stunned Hermione in the dust."Don't mind that jerk" the young girl helped Hermione to her feet "He's like that with everyone"."Jayden Moonstone" the girl introduced herself.Shaking herself off , she replied "Hermione Granger"."Who is he?" Hermione inquired , wondering about the jerky young wizard."That's Barty Crouch Jr." Jayden replied , her voice was riddled with distaste.Blinking back the surprise , Hermione had excused herself politley.It wasn't the question of where she was anymore , but how quickly she could twist the knobs on the time-tuner to return home.She quickly proceeded into the bathroom , finding a empty stall Hermione sat down on the toilet and began twisting the knobs.Click-Click the time-turner wasn't working , Hermione theorized it had been damanged during her altercation with Crouch Jr. in the hallway.This wasn't going to be an easy fix , time-turners were delicate and complcaited it would take time to repair it , months maybe.Headmaster Dumbledore , would be able to fix this ! That was her answer.She immediately hurried off towards Dumbledore's office , this would all be sorted out soon.
