Happiness. Friendships. Presents. Smiles.The pathetic attempt to amuse people with cheap imitations of love. The idea that doing the small acts of family time would change the bonds for years to come. The snide remarks that amuse and annoy the crowd they are forced to settle in.While I am stuck. Stuck alone in a bathroom that leaks. Stuck forever in the cold grey lifeless tome that suffocates my being. Stuck starring at the S of a snake curling around the broken tap.The yellow eyes that haunt my memory always burn brighter when the loneliness of the outside world is pressed on me. I can hear the cheerful laughter of the stupid leftovers, as if they have a right to produce such a noise.The last Christmas I was alive is all I can think of as they parallel the yellow eyes. His kindness that reined over everything as he approached me, because I was alone, like he was. His hand on my knee in an effort to comfort me, which it of course did. The warmth of his tender voice spreading over me.Then the pain of green sharpening its claws in my body. Gripping at my vital organs and making them as black as the bathroom, as black as his heart, as black as I deserve to be. Because it was my fault for believing him, it was my fault for being different, it was my fault that the only good Christmas I ever felt like someone noticed me was with him.So Merry Christmas to those who lie to get ahead.Merry Christmas to those that hide away.Merry Christmas to those eyes that haunt my dreams.Merry Christmas to those who hate every second the Holidays bring.Merry Christmas to the real Tom Riddle.Merry Fucking Christmas, sad, pathetic, horrible, miserable Moaning Myrtle.
