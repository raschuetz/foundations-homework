Hello everyone! It's my first attempt to create a fan fiction so please review to help me out! I hope it's allright Hermione's View"Hurry up, Harry! If we miss the Hogwarts Express I swear I'll feed you to Fluffy. I'm sure he wouldn't mind your hair." Hermione rolled her eyes irritably. If he hadn't been smoothing down his hair in attempt to impress Cho they wouldn't have missed the portkey. Hermione looked at Ron briefly. "Ronald! Loosen your grip or you'll squeeze Pig's insides out like a bottle of ketchup."Mr. Weasley looked up at Hermione. "What's ketchup? Another impressive muggle invention I suppose!" He grinned excitedly. Hermione simply looked uncertain, "Er it goes well with fries, Mr. Weasley" Mr. Weasley beamed, "Fries! Another great invention, I assume!"Hermione shot a brief smile at Mr. Weasley before she was ushered into the train by Charlie. It was their final year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and she was excited as to whom would be made head prefect. She and Ron was made prefects of Gryffindor House and looking at him now, he was as scarlet as his prefect's badge. It didn't take long to figure out why, as she saw Lavender Brown -Ron's crush- not so far away."Earth to Ron Weasley," Hermione took his elbow and steered him to the prefect's compartment, "Sorry Ron but we have a meeting with McGonagall." Ron blushed and gently pulled his hand away. "I'll go make an impression on Lavender first! Catch you later, Mione!" Ron said.Hermione glanced at Harry who was already deep in conversation with Cho about the Tornadoes. He waved slightly at Hermione before turning his attention back to Cho.Hermione shook her head and laughed lightly, making her way down to the prefect's compartment. She slide open the door and froze. A platinum blonde was sitting there alone.
