Harmony's Revenge: A Harry Potter Fan FictionDisclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter or any of its associated characters; all rights belong to JK Rowling; I do own any OC spells explained at the end of a chapter.Plot: Betrayed by friends following the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry uses his mantle as Master of Death to save his most-precious friend from oblivion: however, the consequences of this act of his saving-people thing might just be too big for even Harry to comprehend: here they go again!Author's Note: All right, before I begin, let me go on record as saying that, sometimes, I have said that my inspiration is both a blessing and a curse and, right now, I hate it. No sooner had I put this idea in the Den and come up with a challenge associated with it than the rest of the story started to unfold in front of meso, here we go. As a second point, I'd like to thank everyone who actually encouraged me to continue the idea, and, as always, if you don't like it, don't read it.Dedication: I'd like to dedicate this story to everyone who encouraged my idea to flourish: my recommended reads are Harry Potter and the Vampire Guardian by Demigod of Nyx and, if you haven't read it, I'd also like to recommend Sea of Red by MrGagaSlashLover; two amazing Harmony stories by two truly creative writers.Key Pairing: Harry/HermioneOther Pairings: Eventual Neville/Luna, Eventual Draco/Daphne, Eventual Remus/TonksNormal Speech'Thought'/Parseltongue/'Mind Speech'Chapter 1: "What?"In another time and place, had anyone asked him about it, Harry Potter would have said that the day Lord Voldemort fell once and for all was the greatest day of his life. The battle was over, the fallen had been avenged and the end was in sight: now he could look forwards to a life free of Dark Lords and demons and look forwards to a future of friends, family and freedom.Yeahlike it was ever going to go right for Harry Potter!For the moment that he had returned to the Great Hall, Elder Wand in hand and Hermione at his side, Harry had been apprehended by the Ministry, pinned to the ground, stripped of the Elder Wand and, as the old expression went, clapped in irons.Five minutes later, he was in front of what was left of the Wizengamot and, worse-luck-still, Dolores Umbitch was presiding over the ceremony.Harry didn't even get a chance to plead his innocence thanks to the last voice he'd expected to hear stabbing him in the back."Harry has always been out for power," Ronald Weasley explained, his voice cutting through the courtroom as he gave his evidence, "But look at the facts, Madam Secretary: he can throw off the Imperius, speak to snakes, survive the Avada Kedavra and, over the past twelve months, has caused the deaths of hundreds of noble family members with his actions. Then there's how he allows He-Who-must-Not-Be-Named to enter his mind and wields the very wand that killed Albus Dumbledore: nothing more needs to be said."No; it didn't.Harry was in Azkaban within the hour, but the fall wasn't over yet as Hermione, nearly ten minutes afterwards, joined him in the cell and, to his rage, she was accompanied by Ron and Ginny, the latter holding a vindictive, venomous grin on her smile."Enjoy your time here, Potter!" sneered Ron, "It's about time you got what you deservedI know we will.""What are you talking about, Weasley?" asked Harry, but it was Ginny who said the words.Two words that condemned both them and the future of their world."I'm pregnant."In another time, Harry might have been happy to hear those words, but nowhe just laughed."Can't be mine," he told her, "All I ever got out of you was a sloppy kiss that makes Fang look civil!"A Cutting Hex to the cheek cut off Harry's abuse as Ginny laughed herself before she told him, "What the Ministry doesn't know won't hurt him! Maybe I'll call him Albus Severus, after the two men who helped keep you out of the loop.""Severus?" asked Harry, the memories from the Pensieve running through his mind.However, instead of answering, Ginny and Ron laughed before they left the cellHarmony's RevengeTen Years LaterTwenty-eight year old Harry James Black sat in his cell, thinking about the fact that this day marked a decade since his apparent downfall, his eyes scarred and red and enflamed from hours on end of screaming and nightmares, but they did nothing to hide the glow that filled his eyes even to this day.A glow that signalled only one thing: revenge!It was what had kept him mildly sane while also ensuring that he could keep up with current events in the world beyond his bars; without the threat of a new Dark Lord, things had gone rather well for the world. Percy  'I'm a prick-sucking moron'  Weasley became the youngest Minister while Ron headed the DMLE and Lucius Malfoy was made the new Chief of the Auror Office, which also meant that he was in charge of Azkaban.Hogwarts was handed to McGonagall, though after graduation, Draco Malfoy became the new Slytherin Head while Ginny headed Gryffindor, all the while being a Mother to Harry's bastard son, who she did name Albus Severus Potter.Was she even aware that it spelled out a snake's name in his initials?Other than the progress of his enemies, Harry tuned out the rest of the world's events: he read something about Luna and Neville taking Teddy abroad and leaving Great Britain while the rest of the world moved on, but he didn't much care.He didn't care about anything anymore."Awake?"'Well,' thought Harry, looking to the broken-minded expression of his one and only true love, Hermione Jean Black-Granger, 'Almost nothing.'"I'm awake, my love," Harry told her, holding out his arm while Hermione crawled like a kitten into his lap, snuggling down for comfort as she lay upon him.Hermione was the only real comfort that Harry had, even through the blackness left to him by the Dementors' presence: one year after his son had been born, Harry had called on the ancient magic left to him as Master of Death and renounced his name.It no longer held any honour for him and so he didn't need to care about it: instead, he took the name of Black in Sirius' honour and as was his right as Heir of Slytherin.In that same time, Harry saw how Azkaban was breaking Hermione and, to keep her strong, he'd sacrificed his very blood and magic to keep her close: the way of his magic  even though he knew that in another time, she might have disagreed  bonded Hermione to him through blood, soul and magic: a Dark Blood Wedding.Though the rite hadn't healed her mind, it had, at least, spared her will and spirit: now, she stayed close to Harry, talking when she could and keeping him on the straight and narrow while the world around them crumbled away."They're comingaren't they?""Yes love," Harry answered, already aware of the dark presence drawing near to his cell: maybe it was because he was the Master of Death, but Harry had always known when the dark times were coming.As Hermione cringed against him, Harry gently teased her wild, Bellatrix-worthy brown hair with his skeletal fingers and told her, "Don't be afraid, my dear: I will never leave you.""They're coming to eat usthey want our bodiesthey want our souls"Harry sighed with defeat and a sense of helplessness that he hated: ever since her first real draining from the Dementors, Hermione had snapped mentally and now she had a blankness of logic that made Harry's heart turn black with rage. Her oddness could put Luna to shame, but at the same time, Harry didn't know what he could do.He missed his Hermione.The same Hermione who had been there for seven years and, until at the very end when it really mattered, Harry hadn't managed to do anything to save her or notice her.He'd left her to be used by that traitorous red-head and there was nothing that he could do: instead, he'd been lured in by the Slut and found himself drawn into their web of lies like flies caught by Acromantulas.And now she was at it again: her whimpering and loss of her mindand it was all his fault.Well, he wouldn't let them take his love without a fight: as the darkness closed in, announcing their presence, Harry closed his eyes and, gripping Hermione in his embrace, he whispered, "If I am the Master of Death, then please, whatever force made me so, save her! Save us! Let her be all right again! Please!""Begging, Potter?"With fury in his glare, Harry opened his eyes, seeing the smug expressions of Ron and Ginny in front of him, the lesser with a wand pointed at Harry as he told him, "I'm afraid that won't do you any good: no surviving this time.""You can kill me, you sick and twisted bastard," Harry snarled, "But no matter what life has for me in the next world, I will have my revengefor mefor my Mioneand for everyone that your spite has killed!""Famous last words?" asked Ginny, smiling as she added, "Well at least I can tell Albus his Daddy wasn't short of words at the end.""But you can tell him that his Mummy is a third-rate whore who'd have probably spread her legs for Vol""AVADA KEDAVRA!"The green flash that started all this trouble for Harry brought the end of itHarmony's RevengeBOOM!The sound came so suddenly that Harry didn't have time to acknowledge what was happening.BOOM!"Where's the cannon?" asked a familiar voice, startling Harry as he recognised it; looking around, the young wizard saw Dudley scrabbling for the wall, but hehe was youngerweakerfatter.BOOM!"Who's there?" asked Uncle Vernon shakily, earning a gasp from Harry as the door blew off its hinges and, seconds later, Rubeus Hagrid stepped through the door to a frightened trio of Dursleys and a speechless Harry."What?" asked Harry"Sorry about that," Hagrid rumbled re-attaching the door to its hinges."What?""Boy," Hagrid beamed, mistaking Dudley for Harry as he explained, "I ain't seen yeh since yeh were a baby, 'Arry, but you're a bit more along than I would 'ave expectedparticularly around the middle.""What?!""II'm notI'm not Harry," Dudley stammered as Harry moved forwards."II am"'WHAT?'Harmony's RevengeAt the same time that Harry experienced a sense of dj vu, Hermione was doing likewise as consciousness and the light of life and alertness returned to her, her eyes gazing around as she tried to fight through the fog of confusion that wrapped itself around her mind.Where was she?What time was it?Where was Harry?At the last thought, Hermione felt her heart grow cold as she wondered if her worst fears had come true, but, as though attempting to counter those thoughts, she was brought back to earth with a bump as a familiar Scottish brogue asked, "Are you all right, Miss Granger? You look like you're about to faint."Looking to the forefront of her visionary distance, Hermione felt a gasp lose itself in her throat as she saw Professor McGonagall standing in front of her, slightly younger and less battle-worn than the last time she'd seen the woman, but it was definitely her."S-Sorry," Hermione stammered, a part of her even more surprised as she felt the edge of her large front teeth against her tongue, "Whatwhat did you say?""I was saying that your letter was not wrong," McGonagall answered, earning an oh from Hermione before she added, "That you, Miss Hermione Granger, are a witcha child with magical powers and Hogwarts is a school where you will learn more about those powers."At the mention of Hogwarts, Hermione felt a strong sense of purpose and vengeance rise inside her: now she knew where she was; somehow, she'd been transported back to her first year and it was the day that Professor McGonagall had come to her house explaining about the magical world.But if she was back, then was her Harry?Sure, she knew that Harry himself would be there, but would it be her Harry?Putting her worry to one side for now, Hermione gulped before she addressed the woman in front of her, "Tell me more"Harmony's Revenge"But Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money."Even though he was still curious and a little shocked about the fact that he was somehow back in his weaker, slightly-less physically-endearing eleven year old body, Harry knew that the best thing to do for now was play along. Yet the words of denial and lies that flew from his lips were like venom on his tongue.It had been bad enough to be forced to listen to Petunia rattle on about his Mother once again  though there was a funny side as he saw Dudley get his tail once again  but what had made it really hard for Harry not to show his true self was when they'd met Quirrelmort once again and Harry had been forced to endure the man's falsified stutters.Now in Diagon and letting history play out for the most-part, Harry knew that he had to continue with this faade until he saw her again: if he was back in his eleven-year-old self, then so was Hermione. It was because of her that the powers that be had done this; that much was obvious to Harry: once again, his saving-people-thing had brought unexpected consequences on those closest to him, but if it meant getting his revenge on those who'd turned on him for their own greedy purposes, then it was worth it.Besides, at least this way, Harry wouldn't have to spend years longing for Chang, Slut and winding up with that weird moment in the tent or feeling awkward when Hermione hugged him in the Great Hall. He'd also welcome her support this time in the Tournament and he knew that she'd enjoy him making the lives of their betrayers a living nightmare."Well there's yeh money, 'Arry!" boomed Hagrid, distracting Harry from his train of thought, "Gringotts: there ain't no safer place, not one'cept perhaps Hogwarts!"As he heard this, Harry stopped in his tracks, looking up at the white-marble building with mixed emotions running through him: first of all, why would Hagrid openly announce that Hogwarts was safer than Gringotts?After what Harry had gone through the last time he walked through those doors, he couldn't deny that Gringotts was more like the magical Fort Knox while Hogwarts was you're a-typical safe. At the same time, a sense of suspicion rose in Harry: he knew what awaited him through those doors; namely the traitorous, lecherous imbecile Griphook and his two-way sword of speaking.However, the suspicion was because of how he knew that Griphook would be the one called to take him down to his vault while also taking Hagrid to Vault 713 where the Stone was located.'First the Stone and then he's the one aiding us with the Horcrux,' thought Harry, a part of him wondering if the Horcruxes were still around this time around too, 'It's too much of a coincidence: I have to avoid meeting Griphookjust in case I decide to use his head for Bludger practice!'"Yeh all right, Harry?" asked Hagrid, doubling back as Harry had remained at the entrance to Gringotts. As though he suspected the boy to be somehow afraid or intimidated by the bank, Hagrid continued as he explained, "S'alright; the goblins aren't that friendly, but when it comes to watchin' over yeh gold, there's no be'er guards. They even 'ave dragons down in the lower tunnels: I'd love a dragon, me.""Can't imagine why," Harry replied before he could stop himself, "I've heard they're dangerous creatures.""Nah, just greatly misunderstood, that's all," Hagrid replied and, as he said this, Harry decided that now was a good a time as any to deal with the problem he'd considered earlier.Facing Hagrid, Harry adopted a look of confusion before he asked, "Hagrid, how exactly do I go about getting my money? I mean, do Gringotts use cards or something like that?""Not really," Hagrid answered, Harry's eyes then noticing him patting his pocket as he added, "Although some witches an' wizards use the card things fer the Muggle world, the goblins rely on keys for the many vaults down below. And since yeh were raised by them Dursleys fer so long, I've been given yer key to 'and over to the goblins.""Why would you have it?" asked Harry, the suspicion he'd felt beforehand now rising again as he asked, "If it's my key, then shouldn't I hold onto it?"Now that the words came from his lips, Harry couldn't help but think about the times he'd willingly handed his key to the traitors: first with fourth year while he and the Weasleys were at the Quidditch World Cup; then there was how he'd felt so guilty about his gold when he was in second year.With his key in Mrs Weasley's hands, now that he had a chance to look back on it and think about it, there was no telling what she'd managed to get her grubby hands on with it. And then there was the Slut's parting remark when Harry had denied her bastard son to be his child: what the Ministry don't know won't hurt him.And she'd named him PotterAgain, way too many coincidences here and Harry had been blind to them all.Returning his attention to the conversation, Harry put on his airs and graces before he added, "I'm sorry, Hagrid: it's just that everyone's kept things from me about my family before and, now that I know about thiswhatever it is, I feel like it's a big piece of my life being kept from me. I hope you can understand."Truth be told, Harry did more than hope: he respected Hagrid way too much to risk resorting to magic to get the job done: sure, he'd been a little scatter-brained at times, but he had never failed in his loyalty to the young wizard. After the incarceration, Harry learned that Hagrid had been chased out of the country by Umbitch and gone to work for Charlie in Romania while naming a baby dragon Harry in honour of his friend.So yeah, despite the vengeance that burned in his heart at this surprise twist of fate, Harry knew that he couldn't hate Hagrid for what had happened. He would keep the man's friendship and, maybe in time, he'd let him in on the secrets to come and see about gaining an ally with the creatures.With the giants on his side or at the very least aiding him in his magical tutelage, he would have a big advantage over his enemies: besides, getting in with them would also give him a chance to escape Britain for a while.Maybe he'd go to Francesee some old friends"I'm sorry, 'Arry, yeh're right, o' course," Hagrid told him, wiping his eyes with a large handkerchief as he added, "Ere; it's yours."Then, to Harry's relief, Hagrid handed his key to him and, looking to the bank, he sighed before he added, "Look, it's pretty straight-forward where yeh go round 'ere, so 'ow about yeh get yeh money and then 'ead on out ter the Alley. I'll meet yeh after I take care o' some business fer Ogwarts, okay?""Thanks Hagrid," Harry smiled, clasping his key tight and, as Hagrid vanished, a single tear rolled down Harry's cheek at the thought of just how much he truly valued the friendship of the lovable oaf.It was one of the things that, this time, he was determined not to loseHarmony's RevengeUnlike the last time that he had gone into Gringotts, Harry let his mask slip and walked in with strength and confidence, his eyes catching sight of both Bogrod and Griphook amongst the working goblins before he attracted the attention of a shrewd-looking goblin named Riptide. At the sight of the treacherous goblin and the unfortunate one, Harry felt his old hatred flare up before he managed to hide it behind his noble front.Handing the goblin his key and giving his name to the teller had earned Harry a look of mutual respect from the goblin before he'd been taken down to his vault and shown the many piles of gold, silver and bronze.When he left with more than enough for a couple of terms, Harry faced Riptide before he asked, "Begging your pardon, Master Riptide, but might I trouble you to answer a dilemma for me?""Given the respect you've shown me today, Master Potter," answered Riptide, his voice calm as he explained, "I find myself obliged to give you as much of my time as you need: how may I assist the Most Noble and Ancient House of Potter further?""Well," Harry replied, knowing that he had to be careful how much foreknowledge he revealed, "I heard aa rumour that families like mine don't just have vaults like this one, do they?""Indeed not," Riptide answered, "The House of Potter actually holds sway over four different vaults counting your Trust Vault, Master Potter: the Vault of Potter, the Vault of Gryffindor and the Vault of Peverell."'So I was right,' thought Harry, remembering how he'd always thought of his connection to the Hallows as being more than just coincidence, 'My family are descendants of the Three Brothers, which makes the Hallows all mine by birth-right.'Keeping his mask in place, Harry asked, "Would I be able to access those vaults?""Unfortunately not," Riptide answered, "Due to edicts handed down from the Inheritance Departments of the Ministry of Magic, you would need your magical guardian's signature of approval to rightfully access those vaults before your thirteenth birthday.""Why then?" asked Harry, "From what I was told, it was seventeen that a wizard was considered of age.""Yes," answered Riptide, a part of him sensing that this human knew more than he was letting on; still, Gringotts had always valued the assistance and custom of the House of Potter and its predecessors, so, rather than risk the dishonour of losing a prominent client, he would let sleeping dragons lie. "However, as you are recognised as a Magical Heir of a Noble and Ancient Household, you are immediately recognised as Orphan status in magical terms and, according to the laws of the land, you can claim your Lordship and all respective titles upon your thirteenth birthday."'And I'd bet every Galleon in every vault that a certain someone knew this,' thought Harry, inclining his head in thanks before he asked, "My guardians, who are Muggles, you understand, once mentioned things called audits where you could learn what was at least in those vaults: even though I'm not thirteen, would you be able to perform such a deed? I'd pay handsomely for your services, Master Riptide.""Master Potter," Riptide remarked, his smirk showing through the usual goblin apathy as he explained, "You are well-read for someone raised by Muggles, but nonetheless, my answer is yes: and, furthermore, as my key client, the Most Noble and Ancient House of Black, has ties to your family through its past, I will not only accept the responsibility of auditing the vaults and sending you the details, but, with your express permission, I would be honoured to accept the post of Overseer of your vaults, which would mean that any business concerning those vaults comes through me.""Then you have my permission, Master Riptide," Harry told him, "And, if you need to reach me for any reasons, you'll either find me at my home address or at Hogwarts. I appreciate this service and wish you to know that I was not lying when I said I'd pay handsomely.""My payments are made by the House of Black, Master Potter," Riptide explained, "But I thank you for your honourable generosity: now, shall we return to the main entrance?""Yes," Harry answered, keeping his mask in check as he knew that the slightest slip-up about knowing he was distantly related to the Blacks would reveal way too much.And that, after everything he'd lost already to lies, secrets and deceptions, would be the worst thing that could possibly happen.Leaving the bank with a final farewell to Riptide, Harry had just stepped out into the overcast atmosphere beyond when a feeling like a lightning strike shot through him, electrifying his heart and filling him with warmth that he hadn't felt in a very long time.Lifting his head, Harry scanned the crowds of people making their way through the Alley and, as he looked towards Flourish and Blotts, a slight laugh escaping him in the process as he realised the irony here, his green eyes widened when he saw them.A familiar pair of the world's most-beautiful, most bedazzling chocolate-brown eyes looking right back at him from underneath a head of messy brown hair and, unfortunately, large front teeth.He had found herHarmony's Revenge"Miss Granger, with your thirst for knowledge, it would not surprise me to see you in Ravenclaw!"Hermione tried not to laugh as she left Flourish and Blotts with Professor McGonagall and her parents in tow, both of the Grangers as surprised as Hermione at the amount of knowledge held within the magical world. Even now, she could still feel the same awe and longing for knowledge that had burned within her in her first year, but, as she left the shop, she knew that longing was only outweighed by one other longing sensation.And, as she looked down the Alley towards the rest of the shops, her eyes were suddenly drawn to that very source of the longing within her, a fuzzy, tingling sort of warmth filling her as she looked at the source.Slightly smaller, dressed in the same overhanging clothes as always, but with those dazzling, cold-edged emerald-green eyes that had kept her mind in check even through the black mists of her snapped state.She had found him!"Miss Granger?""Sorry, what?" asked Hermione, turning to face her parents and Professor McGonagall, all three of whom were now looking down the street themselves."Something wrong, Princess?" asked Daniel Granger, his eyes following his daughter as he asked, "What's got you so distracted?""I think it's that charming-looking young man walking over here now," added Emma Granger, her eyes catching sight of Hermione's source as the young girl turned.Professor McGonagall, however, was speechless as she saw him: Harry James Potter, looking a little worse for wear, but walking towards the bookstore with a look in his eyes that reminded her of Lily whenever she found something that caught her attention.When he finally stopped in front of them, Harry gave them all a curt smile before he spoke, "Sorry for that: I tend to attract the wrong sort of attention: my name's Harry, Harry Potter; what's yours?""I'm Hermione Granger," Hermione answered, the tone of her voice and quickness of her diction just as amusing to Harry as it had been in the other time, "These are my parents and this is Professor McGonagall from Hogwarts: are you a new student, Harry?""I am," Harry answered, extending his hand to Hermione before he added, "It's nice to seemeet you, Hermione."As the two shook hands, Dan and Emma both shared a look while Professor McGonagall felt her heart grow warm as she saw the two almost click together in their meeting.So different and yet so similar.For some reason, she was reminded of another odd couple back in the old days;And while one of those two was Lily Evans  which was how she saw Hermione  the other one that Minerva thought of wasn't James Potter.In fact, it was someone who, when he saw this respective young man at Hogwarts, might just be in for the shock of his lifeAnd there we go: Chapter 1 and our dark heroes have reunited, but what force could have sent them back and, more to the point, why?What do they have to gain aside from changing a few key moments in their history for the better of their future?Keep Reading to Find OutNext Chapter: Harry receives a surprise gift from his time-travelling benefactor and Hermione has a request for her parents; plus, once they're alone, the two talk about the future and decide on what will change and what stays the samePlease Read and ReviewAN: Like I said, I couldn't keep this one out of my head, so I hope you enjoy it: oh, and if you're interested, the challenge that I mentioned in my notes can be found in my forum: 'Anti-Hero Harmony'
