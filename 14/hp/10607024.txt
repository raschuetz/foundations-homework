It was unexpected. Remus had been simply reading when it happened. The gentle notes of the piano floated around the air, and he sat up straighter and thought about who could be playing the music. There were two other people currently in Grimmauld Place- Nymphadora and Sirius. The thought of Nymphadora sitting down quietly and playing an instrument was absolutely absurd, and he knew Sirius couldn't play the piano. So Remus set out in search of the mysterious piano player. He quickly made his way up the stairs, healed from the last full moon, and made his way to where the sounds were. Silently pushing the door open, Remus looked inside the room and was shocked at the sight that lay before him. Nymphadora, the person who tripped over nothing and everything, was calming playing the piano with graceful fingers. The notes soared up and down lightly with the softest touch, and she had an evident smile on her face. The piece Nymphadora was playing was calming, and that seemed so unlike her that Remus wanted to laugh out loud. Remus quietly made his way to a chair, unnoticed by Nymphadora, and sat down. He leaned back and closed his eyes, the piano music luring him to sleep.
