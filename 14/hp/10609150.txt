The Little Wolf CubChapter oneThe CubSirius Black and Remus Lupin were like brothers, they even lived together now, (Sirius had run from his family of dark wizards) and they had always been best friends, as an Animagus and a werewolf the two had always spent the full moon together.And this one was no exception, the two other Animagi that made up the group of four friends from school known as the Maurauders, were not in attendence this full moon.James Potter was with a heavily pregnant Lily, and Peter Pettegrew was helping his mother through a difficult illness.So it was that this perticuler night of the full moon the two friends were romping through a forest in the south of Briton.Sirius changed into Padfoot, (a large black dog capable of keeping the werewolf under control) and Remus underwent a more difficult transformation into Moony. (the werewolf)Padfoot was keeping Moony away from people he could bite, when it happened, the thing that would change the life of the two friends forever.Moony smelled other werewolves, this may not seem like much but wolves are possesive, maybe it was that Moony was there first, maybe it was that he just hated these perticuler werewolves, for what ever reason Moony began to run further into the woods.As Padfoot followed he began not only to smell the wolves, he began to smell blood, they entered a small clearing were a fully grown male werewolf was fighting what looked like a little fur ball but was in fact a female little wolf cub.It was attacking the monster and getting badly beat, the little wolf attached itself to the large wolf and the wolf shook it off, the poor little thing yelped, and Moony took off running, he chased the wolf out of the clearing and out of the forest.After he'd chased the wolf away from her, the little cub turned to face what she'd been protecting, at first Padfoot thought it was a pile of wood, but as he got closer he realized it was a pile of bodies.The little wolf cub looked up and began to howl, a heartbroken keening howl that resonated through the forest.As Moony re-entered the clearing the little cub turned from the four bodies she'd been guarding, took one look at Moony and ran into the house, Moony glanced at Padfoot and then turned to enter after her.There were a few moments of silence, and then growls and snarls cut through the night, things again went silent, and then Moony came out of the house, carrying the cub by the scruff of her neck like a mother cat carries her kittens.Than Padfoot looked closer and realized that the cub was in fact a tiny werewolf, little differences and experience told him this, her snout was shorter than a normal wolf's her tail tufted, and her eyes were almost completely human. (Other than the fact that they were amber gold)As he realized that they had rescued a small werewolf he began guesstimating her age, as little as she was the little cub couldn't be more than three or four years old.Although she was a little beat up from her fight with the wolf, this small cub was already fighting Moony; looking rebellious she struggled and nipped to get free.When Moony put her down she immediately ran to the other side of a tree and then peeked around it at them both, when Moony got up to follow her she yelped and ran from him, he caught her and picked her up again to give her a shake.He was gentle but still made her stay, Padfoot realized he had it under control and he turned and padded slowly into the house.He then transformed into human form so he could search the house better, and what Sirius found made him angry.The family was full of muggles, with no knowledge of magic.From the pictures covering the walls the little girl had had two brothers and her parents killed, though what they had done to anger a werewolf and why the wolf had turned the little girl remained a mystery.Looking through wallets and purses Sirius soon found that the family's name was Johnson, Sirius found that one of the child's dead brothers had been no more than fifteen, he also found out more about the little girl.Her name was Adriana Rose, she was three years old, and from the pictures, she was adorable.Deep blue eyes looked up at you from behind long wavy black hair; she was small, even for a three year-old.Sirius found her room next, and began shrinking her things to fit into a bag he'd found downstairs.Sirius had known Remus for nineteen years, he knew him better then he knew himself, Remus would want to take her with them, he would feel responsible for the child.not many wizarding families would take in a werewolf, and muggle orphanages were out of the question, as were werewolf packs.No, Moony would want to keep her, and if he was honest Sirius couldn't live with himself if he were to abandon this little Adriana after having found her.He finished packing her things and turned to go, the difficulty would not be taking care of a child, he and Remus could handle that, no the difficulty would be making things look like an accident to any muggles who came by, and then explaining this to the Ministry of Magic.Sirius went through the rest of the house, and then walked outside, it was 5:00 now and the sun would be rising soon.Sirius left the house and went back outside, "Moony" he called, and the werewolf came running from behind a small shed."Could you take the cub to our apparition point? I'll take care of the bodies and meet you there."Moony nodded and turned to pick up the little wolf, when they had gone out of sight Sirius pulled out his wand and levitated the bodies, bringing them into the house, and then he went outside and locked the door.Turning around Sirius pointed his wand and muttered a spell, the house burst into flames, and Sirius threw the bag of things over his shoulder, and then transforming into Padfoot he ran to find Moony and Adriana.Thanks for reading! reviews are welcome but not mandatory.hope you all liked it, Christina Salvatore.
