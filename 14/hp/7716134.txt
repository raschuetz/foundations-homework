After being annoyed by his cousin, Harry wishes for the Golbin King to take Dudley away; instead, he gets the Goblin Prince, Draco Malfoy. Draco is willing to make a bargain; he will return Dudley without his cousin remembering anything, if Harry will stake his own freedom on solving the Labyrinth. Harry agrees, and so our story begins...Harry Potter and the Goblin KingNo one can blame youFor walking awayToo much rejectionNo love injection.The girl stood proudly, back straight and no sign of fear in her eyes as she faced the demon who had kidnapped her brother."Give me the child," she said, her strong voice ringing throughout the space, "Through dangers untold and hardships unnumbered I have fought my way here to the castle beyond the goblin city to take back the child that you have stolen. For my will is as strong as yours, and my kingdom is great-" (1)"Freak! What are you doing? I'm hungry!" Harry Potter jumped as his cousin bellowed at him from the room next door, "Where is my lunch? You'd better bring it right now or I'm telling!""Just a minute," Harry replied sighing as he turned off the movie and walked upstairs to where his cousin, Dudley Dursley, was lying in bed, wrapped in blankets, "What do you want for lunch?""I want-""Beef stew it is," Harry interrupted, "Good choice, Dudders. I'll be right back." He ignored his stuttering cousin and went down to the kitchen to get lunch. "I can't believe I'm stuck here watching my stupid cousin when I'm supposed to be on that cruise with Hermione and the Weasley's." He growled as he fixed a bowl of stew for Dudley, thinking of all the ways he'd get even with his family once he turned seventeen and was able to use magic outside of school.This summer was supposed to be the best ever; the Weasley family had won a cruise for the family, and since Bill and Charlie were unable to take time off of work, and Percy was still being a git they had invited Harry and Hermione to join them, figuring that it would be a good way to help him get over the loss of his godfather. Of course, no one knew that Harry had done some research on the veil that Sirius had fallen into, and he was working on a way to get him back...so, yeah, Harry was looking forward to the cruise. Then, Harry's stupid cousin had to get sick the weekend he was supposed to be leaving, the same weekend that his Uncle Vernon had a very important business conference in Italy that Aunt Petunia had to accompany him on, and there was no one to stay with Dudley...so Harry had been ordered to stay home until they returned. Normally Harry would have ignored the command, since he didn't think much of his intolerant relatives, but somehow Dumbledore had heard about the situation, and he told Harry that he was not to leave his relatives house while his cousin was sick. So, now Harry was stuck at home, looking after his whining cousin, and he would be alone on his birthday, again. Sighing, Harry took the food upstairs."Well, at least Hermione lent me some movies to watch," he said to himself, "I'm glad I got that television and DVD player fixed. Now, if I could just get Dudley to shut up and stop interrupting me every ten minutes.""I heard that!" Dudley said, as Harry came back into the room, "You're supposed to be taking care of me, not watching stupid movies. I'll tell Mum and-""Just eat your lunch and take your medicine," Harry said. "It's your fault I'm stuck here and I don't feel like listening to you whine for the rest of the weekend. You're not even sick; you just didn't want to be stuck at that stupid business conference this weekend.""Prove it," Dudley smirked, taking his lunch, "You have no choice but to do what I say; even that freaky headmaster from your freaky school said so. I know it's your birthday tomorrow, and all your friends will be off having fun without you, while you watch stupid movies; what's the matter? You want to go back to your room so you can fantasize about David Bowie being your goblin king?""You are so obnoxious!" Harry said, "Merlin, I wish the goblin king would come and take you away, right now!" He turned and stormed out of the room to the sound of his cousins' hysterical laughter. Just as he was about to enter his own bedroom, the laughter stopped and the house went dark. "Dudley?" He called out, "Oh, Diddykins? What are you doing?" He entered Dudley's room again, only to find that it was completely dark. "Okay, Dudley, cut the crap! This isn't funny anymore!" He stormed over to his cousins' bed and pulled back the blankets to find the bed empty. "What the...Dudley? Oh crap; I can't believe I lost my cousin! I am so dead!" A low chuckle sounded in the darkness, and Harry spun around, trying to see who was in the room with him. "Who's there? Show yourself! I'm not scared of you!""I didn't expect you to be," a familiar voice drawled, "Of course I also didn't expect to be called on by Harry Potter, the famous savior of the wizarding world.""Malfoy?" Harry said, "What's going on? Why are you here? And what happened to the lights?" As he spoke, the room became illuminated by a pale silver light, and he could make out the form of Draco Malfoy standing by the window."There, is that better, Potter?" Malfoy asked, making sure to stay in the shadows, "as for why I'm here, well I thought it was obvious; you called me.""Wh-what?" Harry stammered, "I did not call you! All I said was..." his eyes widened in understanding, "I called the goblin king, my cousin disappeared, and then you showed up so that means...you're the goblin king?""Of course not," Malfoy scoffed, "I'm the goblin prince; my father is the king, but since I will be taking over for him eventually he sent me tonight. Now-""Why are you hiding in the shadows?" Harry demanded, "What are you up to?""You are very annoying Potter, did you know that? I was just trying to add a little drama to the situation." Malfoy sighed, but he stepped out of the shadows and moved forward to stand in front of Harry causing the brunette to gasp in astonishment.Last time he saw Malfoy on the train both boys were about the same height, but now Draco was about six inches taller than Harry, and the outfit Malfoy was wearing- a sheer silver button up shirt and tight black pants that clung to him like a second skin-showed off his lithe, quidditch-muscled body to perfection. Malfoys' hair had always been a pale blonde, almost white, but now it shone silvery in the moonlight, and his eyes were no longer stone grey but an icy blue. To Harry, who had come to realize he liked boys after that disastrous kiss with Cho, Draco Malfoy looked like a sex god."See something you like?" Malfoy smirked."Just...shut it, git," Harry muttered, fighting a blush, "Can you bring my cousin back, Malfoy?""Sorry," Malfoy just smirked some more, "You called on me to save you from your cousin, so he belongs to me now; you should just forget about the stupid muggle.""Believe me, I'd love to," Harry said, "Unfortunately, my aunt and uncle would kill me if they came back and found out that I sent their precious son to live with the goblins...will he really turn into a goblin?""You really are clueless, aren't you?" Draco drawled, shaking his head, "Of course he won't turn into a goblin; you called me without even knowing the truth, didn't you?""I didn't think you were real," Harry replied, "I mean, I knew you were real, Malfoy, but I thought the goblin king was just made up by muggles; I watched the movie earlier today-""Oh no! Not that piece of trash with David Bowie!" Draco looked scandalized, "That movie is just insulting! I mean, we all know goblins are below wizards, but the stereotypes in that movie are ridiculous. Now, normally I would just skip right to the part where you beg me to release your cousin, and I laugh and taunt you, but I refuse to move any further until you know the truth about my family." He looked around the bedroom and sneered, "Where is your sitting room?""The living room is downstairs, but-""Well then, Potter, lead the way," Draco interrupted. Harry just glared at him for a moment until Draco raised his eyebrow, and then he sighed, shaking his head."Fine, this way," Harry led the blonde downstairs, "I suppose you want some tea as well?" He looked over his shoulder, and stumbled when he found Malfoy just a step behind and almost touching him. When Harry started to fall, Draco grabbed his arm and steadied him, smirking."Careful Potter," he let go of the other boys arm, "I would like some tea, at least you are civilized enough to offer." He brushed past Harry to the bottom of the stairs, "So, this is it?" He curled his lip in distaste as he looked around the living room. "Your family has absolutely no taste, Potter. At least now I see where you get your fashion sense, or lack thereof." He looked down his nose, sneering at Harry's outfit. The brunette was wearing a pair of ripped jeans that were held up by a piece of rope, and a grey t-shirt that was practically hanging off his small frame."It's not my fault," Harry grumbled, "I have to wear my cousin's old clothes, and if you've seen him you know he is about three times my size.""Humph," Draco said, moving until he was standing directly in front of Harry, "Well, you look like a beggar. And do you ever even try to brush your hair?" He made as if to ruffle the smaller boys hair, but Harry ducked growling, so Draco snatched the glasses off his face. "You only redeeming feature is your eyes, but of course you hide them behind these hideous glasses; they look much brighter without the glasses, like emeralds..." He raised his hand as if he would touch Harry's face, but then dropped it and walked over to the couch, ploppingdown gracefully. He tossed the glasses back to Harry and, even with blury vision, his seeker skills enabled him to catch his glasses. After he put them back on, Harry just stood there for a moment, lost in thought.'He looked like he wanted to touch me,' Harry thought, 'That was strange and the way he looked at me, as if maybe he liked me...' He shook his head, 'I was obviously imagining things.'"UmmI'll just go get the tea," Harry said, "Be back in a minute." He rushed into the kitchen, leaving Draco alone with his thoughts.Life can be easyIt's not always swellDon't tell me truth hurts, little girl'Cause it hurts like hell'That was close,' Draco thought to himself, 'I almost touched Potter; almost let him know' He sighed and closed his eyes, 'The Golden Boy of Hogwartshe would never look at me as anything other than an enemy under normal circumstances, but nownow I have a chance to make him mine.' He smirked, 'All I have to do is get him to accept the challenge of the labyrinth to save his cousin, and then Potter is as good as mine. He will definitely need some new clothes if he is to be seen with me; maybe I can give him a new outfit before he starts his journey? Yes, I think I will, and that will give me another advantage since he will owe me for the favor. It seems things are finally working in my favor, thank Merlin!'"Here, Malfoy," He opened his eyes as Harry returned with the tea tray and handed him a cup, "It has four sugars in it.""You know how I like my tea?" Draco raised his eyebrow, "I never knew you cared; oh, and are those blueberry scones? My, my, you have been paying attention to me; does the Weaslette know her boyfriend is attracted to me?""I'm not attracted to you," Harry blushed, "and I'm not dating Ginny; she's like a sister to me and she's the only one who knows-" He clapped a hand over his mouth and then took a sip of tea, hoping Malfoy would let the matter drop; he should have known better."She's the only one who knowswhat? What is the deep, dark secret you've shared with the she-weasel?""Don't call her that," Harry glared at him, "Besides, I thought you were going to tell me your story, not the other way around.""Very well," Draco said, "but I'll find out eventually. Now then, I guess it's time to educate you about my kingdom." He settled back in his chair to get comfortable, and then started his story:"A very long time ago, certain magical creatures lived in a different dimension; there were centaurs, merpeople, goblins, dwarves, and the Fae, to name a few. Now, the Fae were the most powerful magical beings in the realm, and as such they ruled over the other beings. Eventually, wizards found their way into the realm, and the king of the Fae realm took a beautiful witch for his wife. The king and his new queen had twin sons named Jerriko and Jareth.When it was time for the king to pass on his crown, he decided to send Jerriko back to the wizarding world and chose Jareth as his successor. Jerriko was jealous of his brother, for he wanted to rule the realm, and so he placed a curse on the crown; whoever wore the crown would be doomed to rule alone, never to find their true love. The king and queen begged Jerriko to remove the curse, but he refused and vanished into the wizarding world, never to be heard from again. Once he was gone, the full extent of his curse became apparent; most of the magical beings left the Fae realm leaving only the Fae and the goblins. In addition, the goblins that remained were changed so that they were little better than animals, blindly following the rulers of the realm, all of their cunning gone. Because of this, the realm soon became known as the Goblin Kingdom, and another facet of the curse was revealed; humans-wizards and muggles alike-now had the power to call on the Goblin King and he had to answer their summons to take away children as asked. Of course, most people did not understand that the Goblin King was real, and wanted to get the children back, so Jareth came up with a way to give them a chance; a magical labyrinth was built, and the petitioners, as we call them, had a chance to when back their child if they solved the labyrinth. If the petitioner was unable to solve the labyrinth, the child would belong to the goblin kingdom forever but they were not turned into goblins; they were merely raised as part of the Fae society, some as servants while others were adopted by members of the court.For five hundred years Jareth ruled alone, until he was visited by Merlin-yes, the Merlin-who was able to change the curse. Now, if someone called upon the goblin king and they solved the labyrinth, they had the option to remain in the realm as a co-ruler if Jareth agreed. Eventually, a witch came along who was able to solve the labyrinth and she chose to stay as co-ruler with Jareth, and she gave him a son andwell I won't go into details of the family tree, but suffice it to say the crown was passed down through the family until it came to my father. Jareth is my five times great grandfather and once I reach my majority the throne will be passed onto me. Any questions?""What about the goblins?" Harry asked, "Are they still?""Yes," Draco replied, "They are still bound as servants to the royal family, and we have not been able to return theirprevious personalities to them. There is a prophecy about joining another great wizarding family with mine and finally breaking the curse, but the exact wording of the prophecy was lost long ago so I have no idea what will be required to bring that about.""Another prophesy," Harry glared, "Prophesies are nothing but trouble." He stood up and walked over to the cupboard under the stairs, leaning his head against the door, "Yeah; I've had more than my fill of prophesies." His mind flashed back to that night at the ministry and he saw it all in his mind's eye once again; the fight for the prophesy, curses flying back and forth, Sirius falling through the veil"I'll get him back; I swear I will find a way""Get who back?" Harry jumped as Draco spoke from right behind him, "What has you so upset?""It's nothing," Harry said, walking back over to the couch, "So, what do I have to do to get my worthless whale of a cousin back?" Draco shook his head."Forget the muggle," he said, "he is already in my realm and-""Let's just cut the bull shit," Harry interrupted, "I already know there's a way to get him back, so just tell me the rules so we can get this mess taken care of; my cousin hates all things magical, so trust me-you don't want him in your kingdom any longer than absolutely necessary.""Well, when you lose I will be stuck with him anyway," Draco retorted, sitting next to Harry on the couch."I won't lose," Harry said, amused, "I have never lost to you, and I don't intend to start now.""Very well," Draco smirked, completely ignoring the insult, "Since you never lose, let's change the stakes, shall we?"But down in the undergroundYou'll find someone trueDown in the undergroundA land sereneA crystal moon."What did you have in mind?" Harry asked wearily."Oh, nothing much," Draco replied, "Just instead of fighting for your cousins freedom, how about your freedom being the prize?""What?" Harry squeaked, "My freedom?""Yes," Draco said, "I will open the doorway to the goblin realm and you will have a certain timeframe to solve the labyrinth and make your way to my castle, where you will find another door back to this realm. If you win, you are free to come back here or you may remain in my realm as a free subject or advisor; it's your choice. If, however, you fail to solve the labyrinth in the time allotted you will become my""Yourwhat?""Well, basically just mine," Draco said, giving Harry a look that made his cheeks flush, "Either way, if you agree to my terms I will release your cousin immediately and he will have no memory of this experience.""Just out of curiosity," Harry began hesitantly, "If, by some strange twist of fate I happen to lose to you, will I still be able to return to Hogwarts?""Of course," Draco said, "I don't want some un-educated cretin in my castle.""And you won't turn me over to your father? Or Voldemort?""No; if you don't solve the labyrinth you will be mine, and no one will be able to take you from me," Draco explained, "The challenge of the labyrinth is a combination of wizard and fae magic, and it is too strong to be broken by anyone alive today-including the Dark Lord and your precious Dumbledore.""He's not my Dumbledore," Harry glowered, "He's a lying, manipulative, barmy old man.""Hmm, I quite agree," Draco said, "but what changed your mind about your hero?""He has been keeping important things from me from day one," Harry replied angrily, "If he had only told me the truth, maybe I wouldn't have gone to the ministry that nightand maybe Sirius wouldn't have fallen through the veil." He shook his head again, "It doesn't matter though; just know that I am no longer Dumbledore's' puppet. So, what makes you think I am crazy enough to risk my freedom in the labyrinth?" Draco was surprised by the change in topic, and it took him a moment to answer."As you said, you've never lost to me before; maybe you're worried that you won't get luck this time?" He challenged, "After all, this time you will be on your own; everyone knows you can't accomplish anything without your little groupies.""Fine," Harry said, eyes glittering, "I accept your terms; you release my cousin and I will take on your labyrinth.""Excellent," Draco grinned, and Harry was taken aback by how attractive it made the blonde look, "Here is the contract; once you sign it we can begin." Harry looked at the contract and then read it out loud."I, Harry James Potter, do hereby accept the challenge of the labyrinth; in exchange for the return of my cousin, Dudley Dursley, I agree to have my freedom be the prize. If I am able to solve the labyrinth within the allotted time I will have my freedom and the choice to return home or remain in the Fae Realm as a free subject or advisor. If, however, I should fail to solve the labyrinth, my freedom will be forfeit, and my life, freedom and magic, along with all that I am and all that I own will belong to Draco Lucius Malfoy. I understand that this contract is legal, binding and irrevocable." He looked at Draco and accepted the quill the other boy offered."This is a blood quill," Draco told him, "It is part of what makes the contract binding; once you sign it, I will add my own signature.""Why do I have a feeling I am going to regret this?" Harry took a deep breath and signed the contract, watching as his signature shone bright red for a moment before drying to become a dark reddish-brown. Without another word, Draco took the quill and the contract and wrote at the bottom, in elegant script, "I, Draco Lucius Malfoy, do hereby agree to abide by the above terms" before adding his signature."Here," Draco pulled out a healing salve and handed it to Harry after applying it to his own hand, "This will prevent it from scarring up." Harry accepted the salve bemusedly."It doesn't really matter," he said, applying the salve, "I already have scars from last year anyway, what's one more?""Let me see," Draco grabbed his hand and frowned at the faint scars," 'I must not tell lies'? Umbridge did this, didn't she? When?""Every time I had detention she made me use her blood quill," Harry replied, "It's really not important. Now, can we get on with this?" He tugged on his hand and Draco dropped it, somewhat reluctantly."Of course," Draco said, "Follow me." He led Harry through the house to the back door, pausing to smirk at the brunette before opening it, "I hope you're ready, because there is no going back." Draco opened the door and Harry gaspedIt's only foreverNot long at allLost and lonelyThat's undergroundUnderground****************************************************************************************************************************************************Author's Note***************************************************************************Okay, so here's the first chapter; what do you think? All opinions are welcome, and any flames will be used for smores! ^_^ I will have the next chapter up ASAP. Oh, and as for Draco's comment about the Labyrinth movie with David Bowie?
