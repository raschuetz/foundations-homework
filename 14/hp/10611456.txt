Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter, and I make no profit from this.Notes: My friend Phil edited this so props to him.Letting out a groan of annoyance and frustration, Harry Potter lifted the hem of his T shirt, and wiped the sweat from his face.He had been finishing the last item on the long list of chores that his Aunt Petunia had forced him to do before his 'family' returned later that evening from the party they had been invited too.He hadn't bothered to ask if he could go, because firstly, he knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that the answer would be no, and secondly, going would involve spending time around the Dursleys when he wasn't obligated to. Nevertheless, Uncle Vernon interpreted Harry's asking where they were going as a request to join them, so as a result, he had the added irritation of his sweat dripping down into the fresh, angry looking lashes on his back.Yanking the last stubborn weed from the garden he had been attending to since he was old enough to speak, he contemplated his existence briefly.This place, this house wasn't his home, the Dursleys weren't his family, no matter how much Albus Dumbledore had argued otherwise. His so called family had hated him since the first time they laid eyes on him, and the feeling was more than mutual.Walking inside the house he took off his oversized old worn-out sneakers and sighed, looking around. Everything was in tip top shape, due to his workings earlier that day, and he was quite proud of himself for getting done so early.He picked up his shoes and stepped up to his room, his muscles aching, his back stinging, and he shut the door quietly. He never slammed a door unless necessary, and tried (mostly out of spite) not to pick up any of his uncle's habits.The thought of looking in the mirror and seeing a younger uncle Vernon terrified him greatly.His clothes, already worn out when Dudley outgrew them, were now caked with dirt, grime, and dust from his chores, not contrasting in the slightest to the tiny single room that he had been grudgingly given.As he stretched, a fresh lance of pain shot through his back as the fresh scabs over his lashes broke open again, and when combined with his headache, forced him to sit down for a moment, waves of nausea threatening to overtake him. This house, and the family inside it were like poison, and he couldn't drink it anymore.And so he decided what he had to do.Normally he would have taken his chance and left as soon as possible, but he felt that everyone deserved this.He felt that his family deserved everything they have given him back, he felt that they had deserved to reap what they had carefully sown. Dumbledore, Ron, Hermione, all of them, they had been content to leave him here to this.So they deserved a bite in the ass.He started with his closet, selecting the five items that he didn't hate with a fierce passion (A Weasly sweater, his school robes, dress robes, a pair of jeans, and his quidditch robes)After a brief consideration, he took the battered and mended shirt from the final task of the tournament last year. It was his only memento of Cedric, and Harry was the only person there to witness his death, so he owed him that much. He did not think of him as a competitor, but as a friend, and as a hero.His trunk went next.He was unable to repress a smile as he opened it, the sight of his books, cauldron, and broom were like a breath of fresh air. But then he remembered his plan, and his face once again turned serious.Emptying out the battered and chipped trunk, he decided that he needed to get a new one. It wasn't as if he couldn't afford it.He separated everything into three piles; keep, trash, and donate.His books took up most of the room and with that he realized he hadn't ever gotten rid of his books, ever, and that most if them weren't in the best shape, despite buying them all new. He put all of his books in the donate pile apart from the photo album Hagrid gave him at the end of his first year and the parchment scrolls he had kept his notes on.He put his Invisibility Cloak and the Marauder's Map into the keep pile without even a second thought, or a first one for that matter, along with his Firebolt.Most of his robes went into the donate pile because they were too small for him but they'd fit other kids who couldn't afford new robes, and his looked almost new.His cauldron, scales, and phials went into the trash pile because they were either broke, bent, dented, or cracked and he needed new ones, and the heavy equipment wasn't worth the trouble of carrying around.He kept his quidditch robes because he needed new ones but they technically belonged to the school, so he had to return them.The rest of his trunk was a jumbled assortment of broken quills, empty ink bottles, and torn parchment, which went into the trash pile.Going downstairs he grabbed a trash bag and an air freshener stick, and went upstairs again. He put the trash pile into the bag, and put his items back into the trunk. He looked over the donation pile and decided he'd put that stuff on top, separated by his bag and broom.He looked around his room and found nothing he wanted to keep apart from his trunk and Hedwig, so he opened her cage and let her free, wishing it would be as easy for him to be free like that."Hey girl, I'm going to go to the Leaky Cauldron. I'll see you there okay?" He said, smiling as she gave him an affectionate nip on the end of his finger.
