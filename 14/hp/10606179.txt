A Bumblebee's FlightSummary: Hufflepuffs are always seen as cowards. We are often compared to fleeing bees due to our gentle demeanor and the colors of our house. But no more! I am a bumblebee, but no longer will I flee.Response to the Music Club's Orchestra challenge. Loosely inspired by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's 'Flight of the Bumblebee' (Really only the title of the song) I was sorted into Hufflepuff at age eleven. I was pleased with my placing, it suited my personality. My house-mates were all kind, and we were like a real family. I knew when I arrived at Hogwarts that my house was stereotyped as a house of pushovers and cowards. When we would leave an irrational or dangerous situation it would be seen as fleeing as opposed to being wise and cautious. They relate us to bumblebees because of the colors of our uniforms and house.I'm done being seen as a coward. I will remain in my house, stay with my family, but no longer will I be compared to a fleeing bee. I will be seen as one stinging.I apologize for how short it is (Just over a hundred words:)) but this is all I could come up with.
