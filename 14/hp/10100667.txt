Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter, I do not have any rights to Harry Potter and I do not make any money from writing these fics.A/N: I know I got a lot on my plate but I promise I'll complete all of my fics plus this looks fun...So I wrote this for the 'Becoming A Wizard - Year One' Challenge on the HPF Forum. I'll be putting everything for this challenge together as a collection if possible.Prompt: To write about someone trying to remember something from when they were very young. Word Limit 100.Trying To RememberEyes shut, he tried to remember. Had they ever been nice to him? Even during his first few days with them had they ever been nice to him? No, they had called him a freak, they had called him a worthless waste of space, a burden on everyone. He tried to remember, he tried to think back to a happy time with them but if there was a happy time it was long forgotten. Pain and suffering was all he could remember.If they thought so little of him, even as a baby...why did they want help from him?End of Prompt.
