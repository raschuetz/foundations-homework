Bundled up in his winter clothes, the boy toddles away from his father's outstretched hands, his little knees deep in the freshly fallen snow."Get back here! Your mom is going to kill me," his father says again, a hand dramatically covering his eyes. She wouldn't kill him but she would nag him about it. They were supposed to be home 30 minutes ago."Daddy!" the boy squealed, showing a toothless smile to his father.His father smiled. He just couldn't deny his son though, especially with that smile. And sometimes he thought the boy knew that as well.He ran up to his son whose pale hair, a spitting image of his own, reflecting the golden light from the setting sun. Once within distance and the boy was distracted, his father scooped him up around the waist. The boy cried out in surprise before his father held him against his chest."Are you ready for Mommy's cookies?" his father asked, knowing the way to his son's heart.With another excited squeal, the pair left the park and walked to their warm home down the street.
