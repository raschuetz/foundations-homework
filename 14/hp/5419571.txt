Now I would follow him into the darkness, hoping he would give me a glance.SummaryA beautiful girl with a secret she needed to keep. Who would ever accept that Katharine Keeler was in love with Severus Snape? Not her friends and especially not her a year of passion and romance he pushes her away and instead of running away she follows him to the darkest part of his life. She wants to be with him, she wants him to love her and she would do anything for him. Even if that meant risking her own life.
