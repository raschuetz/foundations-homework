Consequences of a Full Moon MistakeBy: Accalia SilvermoonDisclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter! If I did, Remus would have married Harry instead of Nymphadora Tonks!Prologue: An Unforgettable Night"Well, Snivellus," the Grim animagus snapped heatedly, "If you really want to know so badly, then why don't you go to the Whomping Willow right now and prod the knot in the trunk, then slip into the tunnel opening between the roots?"Severus smirked viciously. "Why thank you, Black!" the greasy haired teen drawled mockingly. "I do believe I shall!"And with that, Severus Snape had crossed the Entrance Hall and was out the double doors leading onto the grounds.Sirius stood there, eyes wide and hands trembling, frozen in a state of shock, as he suddenly realized exactly what he had just done.Cursing violently, he tore up the stairs to the portrait of the Fat Lady, barked out the password, and collapsed at James Potter's feet barely three steps into the Gryffindor Common Room."Padfoot?" James asked in concern."Prongs..." Sirius gasped out breathlessly."Go now...Snape...I told him...Whomping Willow...knows about Moony...HURRY!"James simply stared at Sirius uncomprehendingly for a few minutes before his eyes widened in horror and understanding."SHIT!""SIRIUS, YOU BASTARD!" James roared, throwing a punch at the other boy's nose.Sirius fell to the floor, clutching his broken nose as blood poured out of it in torrents, as he watched James grab his broomstick, magick one of the windows open, and fly out into the pouring rain.'Oh Merlin, Prongs, please get there in time...' the sixteen-year-old begged silently with tears streaming down his cheeks.
