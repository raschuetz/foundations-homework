Over the last three years, since the fall of Voldemort, Harry watched his life spiral downward into a pit of slavery. It seemed that the longer he stayed in the wizarding world, the more control they gained over him. His friends simply tossed around his name to get whatever they wanted. The minister was always signing off on things that Harry would just have to end up doing.His whole life was turning him into a circus monkey with a crown and a pedestal. He was losing who he was in the chaos of the demands that life gave him. He tried desperately in almost every way to avoid the attention and the fame. Yet it found him like the black plague. It seemed like a losing battle and Harry was never the type to just give up and take it. He wanted to grab his life by the horns. I guess that was the first seed of doubt that implanted itself in his head.He could remember exactly the day that the seed sprouted though. That day he snapped and grabbed back his life. It's funny how the moments in life can drive a man to the brink of insanity before everything snaps into that one moment of clarity. That one moment when you see everything for what it is and take that first step to a new life of freedom. This is the story of how that moment happened and the life that he grabbed after.
