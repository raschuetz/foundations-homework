Harry Dursley - Something's Wrong.Lets get the most important part out of the way i do not own harry potter so anything that you recognize from JKs work probably comes from her. Nearly 10 years had passed since the Dursleys awoke to find their nephew on their front doorstep, Privet drive hadn't changed much since that fateful day. The Sun rose on the same immaculate front garden and lit up the bronze number four on the Dursleys front door, it crept into the living room. In fact the only way to see how much the Dursleys lives had changed was that instead of 1 boy on the family pictures spread across the room there were two.Even though the second boy did not look much like the other Dursleys his jet black hair untameable no matter how hard Petunia tried covering his forehead hiding his lightning shaped birthmark and his bright emerald green eyes a stark contrast to the blue and brown of the rest of the Dursleys, it was clear he was apart of a happy and loving family.Today, the 23rd of June, was a special day for young Harry Dursley and his twin Dudley, today for the only time in his life he would turn eleven and they were going to the zoo! He awoke to the smell of his mother cooking bacon.Harry eagerly got dressed and rushed downstairs happy to see two mounds presents on the table quickly counting he realized he had an extra present than Dudley they had been secretly fighting for their parents favour, Harry wanted the practice to ensure he inherited Grunnings from Vernon whereas Dudley was just interested in getting as many presents as possible.As Dudley arrived the larger boy didn't seem worried about Harry having more presents he had gotten used to it but he still had more than last year and so long as the Racing bike he desperately wanted was there he didn't care.Harry didn't truly care for presents, he liked playing with the vast collection of games he got but the real use he had was getting what he wanted from the children at school everyone wanted to play with the latest games and would do almost anything to use his toys.After the bacon and pancakes Petunia made and unwrapping the mountains of presents it was time for the zoo,Harry and Dudley had a great time looking around the different enclosures with their friends at lunch they both got treated to a Sunday Dudley wasn't happy with his, he had always been greedy about food, another thing which made him different to his twin Harry, so Petunia got him a bigger one and the old one got shared with Harry and Dudley's friends.After lunch they headed to the reptile habitats it was a sunny day and most of the reptiles were just bathing in the sun. Dudley was getting bored."Harry can you make it move, its boring" he said pointing at a large boa constrictor.Harry looked at the snake, shrugged."you know any tricks?" he asked the snake sarcastically.The snake raised its head looking at Harry, and Harry could thought its hissing sounded like a tired "shoo"."this is boring" moaned Dudley "lets go watch the lions they actually did something"Harry gave a final look at the snake he could swear it stuck its tongue out at him."yeah lets go"The rest of the summer passed as normal choosing the toys he would want to keep for himself and the ones he would give away for favours, going to the park with his and Dudley's gang.Until one day the 31st July, a letter arrived.Vernon went to get the post that morning much like he would every morning he put the pile of post on the kitchen table as he ate his breakfast leafing through the post for anything interesting."bill...bill...bill..." he was muttering but when he looked at the next letter his face turned white as if he had seen a ghost, "Pe pe Petunia, quickly come here look."Harry was curious now what would spook his dad so badly he tried to look at the letter but all he could see way the word "potter".Petunia came bustling over from the dishes, she took one look at the letter and."OUT BOTH OF YOU" she screamed at Harry and Dudley, they had never been sent out of a room before much less been yelled at by their mother.Dudley screwed up his face getting ready to unleash his most potent weapon 'crocodile tears'."bu bu but i'm still eating" he managed between deep sobbing breaths."LISTEN TO YOUR MOTHER" yelled Vernon "you can eat later" he added more softly. "Now Get OUT!"Harry swiped a sausage from his plate the he and Dudley hurried out of the room. only to press their ears to the door to try and hear what was going on. Soon they were jostling for the best spot by the keyhole, Harry knew Dudley would win Dudley was so much heavier, so Harry got the sausage out for Dudley."i get the keyhole, you get the sausage" he told Dudley "deal?""Deal".Harry pressed his eye against the keyhole trying to find out what why his parents had reacted like that to a letter, he couldn't hear everything they were saying but they looked worried."what do we do Vernon?""i don't know" sighed Vernon clearly thinking, after a long pause " ... we can't hide from these people we know that from the past no matter how often we moved they always knew where to find us""I can't bear to lose him" sobbed Petunia."Maybe there is a way he wont find out" Comforted Vernon."Right of course.. its not like he is famous in their world or anything... Oh wait he bloody is!" Petunia hissed."look I will think of something, I've never let you down before have I?""I trust you Vernon but I don't know if we can get out of this one""Okay Boys you can come finish your breakfast now" Vernon called.Dudley rushed past harry almost knocking him down in his eagerness to eat, Harry made his way back to his seat looking between his parents, Petunia seemed unable to meet his eyes."what was that about dad?" Harry asked knowing Vernon wasn't going to tell him."oh nothing son, just a bill a bit higher than we thought thats all don't worry we will take care of it" Vernon lied smoothly.The rest of the day passed uneventfully Harry was soon in bed still wondering what had caused such a fuss but unable to figure out what it was.The next day Harry came down for breakfast already finding Vernon and Petunia up, as he entered the room they stopped talking looked at harry with the sort of look he only got when he was in trouble, so never."What sort of a childish prank is this" Vernon accused waving a letter at harry "Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry, who did you put up to this nonsense"Harry had no idea what Vernon was talking about "Can I see it?"Vernon handed the letter to Harry scowlingDear Mr Harry DursleyWe are pleased to inform you that you have a place at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of necessary books and equipment.Term begins 1st September, we await your owl by no later than 31st JulyYours Sincerely Minerva McGonnagallDeputy HeadmistressHarry stared at the letter the hand writing was oddly similar to Petunia's own,"Await your owl? what does that mean?" Harry pondered out loud."Well you should know its addressed to you" Vernon attacked."I've never heard of this place in my life dad I swear" harry pleaded willing Vernon to believe him as much as he could, whenever he had tried this in the past people oddly seemed to listen to him more, but for once he was actually telling the truth."We will see about that boy, I shall write back to this 'school' and get to the bottom of this, if I find out you are lying you will be sorry" Vernon promised.Vernon started writing a reply occasionally snarling away muttering under his breath, Harry sat to have his breakfast.A few hours later whilst Harry was watching T.V and Vernon was reading the paper they heard a tapping from the window.Vernon got up to take a look "what on earth!" Harry heard him in the other room. Getting up to go see what surprised his dad Harry rounded the corner seeing his father with something in his hands the window open and what he could swear was a bird flying away."what was that?" he asked"Its the reply from that school" Vernon told harry reading the letter."Really, I thought that was a joke""It might be a joke, but they seem to take themselves serious enough""So what is it magician school for like card tricks and pulling rabbits out of a hat?" Harry couldn't imagine why you want to go to school just to learn how to entertain kids at parties."They seem to think they do real magic" snorted Vernon "apparently their is a whole community of real wizards and witches living in London in some place called Diagon Alley they even have some instructions on how to get there, these pranksters sure have gone to a lot of trouble""Do you think it could be real?" Harry was curious "I don't see how this can hurt us i mean their not asking for money or anything are they?""Not yet no, I guess it doesn't hurt to have a look" agreed Vernon.So the whole family prepared for a trip into London the next day, Petunia kept making Harry wear a big hat over his face forcing his hair down so it completely covered his birthmark.They all got into the car and drove into London, parking not far from the pub which supposedly was the entrance to the wizarding world.Walking up the highstreet Vernon saw the Pub in question."Here it is" pausing for dramatic affect "The Leaky Cauldron, what dreadful place"It did look bad, the walls were dark peeling the windows looked to be covered in mould so bad they were no longer transparent."if you ask me this is some elaborate scheme to try and get customers" Vernon joked "well lets go get to the bottom of this"He strode in through the front doors the rest of the family following him in.Surprisingly it was a lot nicer inside and quite busy too oddly dressed people wearing pointy hats and robes sat and stood around the pub, which seemed bigger on the inside, drinking bizarrely coloured sometimes fizzing sometimes smoking drinks.Looking around them the Dursleys found the bar, Vernon walked straight up to the bartender."You got me very good" Vernon cried out.The man looked a little confused "Err.. Hello I'm Tom... can I help you?""Yes yes you can drop the act, I got your letter my boys a wizard is he very funny, what is this then? You got Framed? I have to admit you had me for a moment with all these actors dressed up like fools" Vernon was grinning almost manically.Tom seemed to have no idea what Vernon was talking about, then realisation dawned on him. "Oh you must be muggles ey? starting at Hogwarts are you?" he said turning to look at Harry. "You can get to Diagon Alley just through there" Pointing to a door "Hey Kingsley.. help these people into Diagon Alley.. their Muggles""Alright Tom but you owe me I'm off duty you know" a large man in Robes and hat got up from his table motioning for the Dursleys to follow him."Yeah yeah I'll get you a drink on the house you old extortionist" Called Tom.Smiling Kingsley spoke to Vernon "Follow me this way, I'm Kingsley Shacklebolt an Auror for the Ministy" seeing their lack of comprehension he added "Kind of like one of your police officers"They walked out into a dead end with just a few bins and a brick wall."where now Mr Shacklebolt" mocked Vernon.The Man whipped out a long stick prodded a few of the bricks.Harry couldn't believe what happened next, the walls started disappearing into each other folding away leaving a Gateway into a busy street filled with more robed figures."Welcome to the centre of magical Britain" Kingsley announced.Dursleys looked around them in awe even Vernon didn't seem to have an explanation for all of this, up and down the street wizards and witches walked going into shops with strange and wonderful merchandise, a large group of children were gathered around the window of a shop which seemed to sell nothing more than sweeping brooms. Owls flew over head carrying parcels in every direction and between or the wizards and witches Harry was sure he could see the occasional Half sized man with long ears and oddly coloured skin."The first place you will want to go to will be Gringotts, that's the wizarding bank." Kingsley said breaking the Dursleys out of their stupor "Follow me this way"and with that the wizard started walking down the street towards a huge white marble building the Dursleys hastily followed suit.Vernon seemed to have gotten over his initial surprise and was looking at the various Witches and Wizards with a mixture of fear and disgust on his face, Dudley on the other hand was taking note of every shop and stall which seemed to sell food, they made their way past shops selling everything you ever thought was just a children's tale from Cauldrons and magic books to robes hats and wands.It didn't take long for them to reach the bank."I'll leave you to your shopping now, if you can't find anything just ask a shopkeeper for help" Kingsley told them, then thinking of something he added "oh and Gringotts is run by goblins but don't worry they are very good with money" and with that he left them walking towards the pub no doubt to collect on that drink."Well then follow me boys" Harry was surprised at how well Vernon was reacting usually anything which surprised him made him angry.The Dursleys nervously climbed the steps up into the bank pushing open the large doors entering a huge hallway that Harry could swear was bigger than it looked from the outside, their were the halfmen, Goblins around the room weighing metals speaking to wizards and leading families through small exits around the room."Now wait here you two" Vernon told Harry and Dudley "I'll go speak to one of these... nice men about getting some of this wizard money" he looked a little sick just thinking about it.But with a visible act of determination he and Petunia walked up to one of the goblins at the desksHarry could see them talking seemingly not agreeing about something the Goblin getting visibly angry until Vernon seemed to hand something to the goblin whose eyes filled with greed, nodded and smiled at Vernon.Vernon then turned to Harry and Dudley beckoning them over."Griphook take Mr... Dursley" the goblin seemed to have to force the name to leave his mouth "to his vault" Motioning for another goblin to lead the Dursleys onwards he then turned back to the queues of wizards "Next!""Right this way" the goblin named Griphook called leading them towards one of the doors harry had seen earlier, passing through the door they entered a tunnel with a track on the floor and a large mine cart."In the cart you get now" Griphook told them."You expect me to get in that? don't you have lifts or something a little less ridiculous" Vernon complained."If it were up to me.. 'Sir' you would have to pay for the mine cart best way to travel" Matching Vernon's malice Griphook replied "Now if you want your money get in the cart"Grumbling about backwards technology Vernon clambered into the cart and the rest of the Dursleys followed him in. No sooner than they were all in the cart safely did the goblin pull on a lever and the cart surge forward faster than Harry had expected the Dursleys were jerked backwards with the acceleration but the cart didnt stop speeding up faster and faster it went down the tunnel then, it dropped the tunnel went nearly straight down the family fell forwards in the cart trying to brace themselves against the sides to stop themselves from crushing each other. Faster and faster the cart went twisting and turning through rocky tunnels, Harry couldn't help but think this was a ride people would pay and queue for a ride like this in the normal world but wizards got a thrill like this every time they went to the bank. Extraordinary. Dudley however was less impressed he was rapidly turning a shade of green matching the goblins. Griphook noticed."If you will all please look to the right" he called as the cart turned left and at the exact moment that Dudley spilled his guts over the right side. "you learn to spot the sickies quickly on this job" the goblin grinned wickedly.The Cart's speed finally stabilized no longer getting faster but still hurtling through the tunnels at breakneck speeds, they were heading deeper and depper the track now splitting off into tunnels and the tunnels breaking out into huge caverns some with huge doors in the walls as they got deeper harry saw a glimpse of a gigantic lizard curled up as if sleeping outside one of these doors."What was that?!""Just a little bit of security, nothing to be worried about" Griphook had a crazy look on his face "Nobody ever steals from gringotts and gets away with it, not like your muggle banks were all you need is a bag over your head and a firework stick to get rich quick"Vernon took offense but wisely chose to keep his mouth shut as that was the only thing stopping him from doing a Dudley.As they got deeper harry noticed the cart start to slow down, Griphook pulled a lever the Cart shot off to the left straight towards the nearest Door, the cart hurled itsself towards the door barely slowing."YOUR GOING TO CRASH!" Vernon yelled panicked by the insane look on the goblins face.Just as they were about to slam straight into the door the cart stopped throwing the Dursleys out of the cart and depositing them roughly on the stone floor, only Harry and Griphook managed to stay in the cart.Griphook looked at Harry "Right Mr Po..Dursley here is your vault" gesturing to the Large metal vault door with an engraved 687 in the door.The Goblin approached the vault door taking a metal key out from his satchel he placed the key into the lock opening the door. What lay inside took Harry's breath away, Gold and Silver was piled in heaps fit for a dragon the room was nearly overflowing with coins."This is all mine?" Harry couldn't believe what he could see with this much money he could surely do whatever he wanted."Thats right son it said in the letter Hogwarts has a fund for all err what was it muggle born students" explained Vernon."I'll be waiting outside to take you back to the surface" Griphook informed them taking a seat on the edge of the cart.The Dursleys walked into the entrance to Harry's vault. As soon as they were out of Griphooks hearing Vernon steered Harry to one side."Listen to me boy, I don't trust these Goblins" he said spitting the word out "They want your money to stay in their vaults I say you take as much as you can out now and put it in a real bank or something"Harry did as his dad told him, Vernon might be quick to jump to conclusions without thinking things through but he always had a good sense of what to do with money in Harry's experience, He started to fill his backpack with the large gold coins figuring they were worth the most whilst Vernon told the rest of the Dursleys to do the same. After about 15 minutes or so there bags now weighing alot more, Harry was straining to hold his they left the vault, Griphook gave them an exasperated look seeing the lack of trust on the families faces."Ready?""Get us out of here" Grumbled Vernon.Getting back into the cart the family prepared for a much slower journey up the tracks, but somehow the cart was travelling at nearly as ludicrous speeds. Harry kept a look out for the giant lizard trying to get a better look to see what it was but they must have gone another way to the surface as he couldn't spot it on their way to the surface.Not long after they had left the bank and were looking through the list of bizarre shopping they had to do. They decided to get a the basics first things that they at least were familiar with, Heading to a shop supposedly selling magical trunks. Looking through the selection Harry had a hard time believing some of things the trunks claimed to do and so did Vernon by the sounds of it."bigger on the inside what a load of rubbish bunch of scam artists these wizards" but opening the trunk the size of a small washing case and sticking his arm inside and waving it around he soon found himself eating his words "well I'll be dammed"In the end the settled on a middle of the range trunk with Lightening charms and a enlarging spell after buying the trunk they tried to discreetly pour the gold from Harry's vault into the trunk all the while throwing furtive looks around as if expecting to be robbed.Next they headed to a tailor for Harry's school robes, he couldn't believe he was really going to be forced to dress like one of these people but apparently it was school uniform so they walked into Madam Malkins, selecting some new robes Vernon and Petunia left Harry to get his measurements done.When the woman was nearly done taking Harry's measurements a pale faced blonde boy entered the shop, he stood near Harry waiting to be served with an air of self importance about him, Harry had dealt with these types before all you had to do was make them believe you thought the same as them and they were useful allies."Hullo" the boy said "Hogwarts too?""Yes""My Fathers next door buying books and mothers just up the street looking at wands " drawled the boy sounding bored "Then I'm going to drag them off to look at racing brooms, I don't see why first years can't have their own. I think I will bully father into buying one and smuggle it in somehow"Harry immediately liked the boy he knew what he wanted and how to get it."Have you got your own broom" he continued on."Not a racing one" Harry replied trying to hide his ignorance."Oh, play Quidditch at all?" The boy seemed to sound less bored as he went on."I was hoping to start soon" Harry replied watching the boys face close "my parents haven't let me before""oh that sucks, my dad lets me play he says it will be a crime if I don't play for my house, and I must say I agree, you know what house your going to be in yet?""well you know what they say only one way to find out" Harry bluffed."Yeah true I guess, but I know I will be in slytherin, all of our family have been - imagine being hufflepuff I think I'd leave wouldn't you?""I don't think I could live with the shame" Harry said hoping the boy would talk about something he knew anything about."I say look at those to muggles my fathers talking too""What?" Harry said trying to get a look but Madam Malkin stopped him from turning as she fitted his new robes."They look so clueless, I guess they managed to breed another muggleborn idiot""Yeah, those muggleborns are starting to take over, I mean you could even be talking to one and not even know it" Harry said ironically."Eugh, I don't want muggle germs" the boy said in mock disgust."All right dear we are all done now" Madam Malkin told Harry."I'll be seeing you at Hogwarts then" the boy called "I'm Draco, Draco Malfoy"Reaching the door Harry called back "I'm Harry the one and only I'll be seeing you around" closing the door behind him he decided not to greet his parents until draco was no longer staring at them as if he was in a zoo. Dudley followed him out of the shop when Madam Malkin woke him were he had fallen asleep.Harry slowly walked towards his parents who were talking to a Tall blonde man clearly Draco's father, they looked slightly nervous and Harry couldn't hear all of what they said."Can you make sure know one finds out or not?" he heard Vernon ask."Don't worry Mr Dursley I'll make sure no one ever knows the truth" The Wizard said leaving the couple"Oh Harry, Dudley your finished" Petunia called to them"Dad can I buy a broom?" Harry asked Vernon a plan forming in his mind."No son its not on the list" Vernon told Harry gently not liking to deny him a gift."But dad that blonde boy at the shop is going to get one" Harry began "and we don't want to be made to look poor by one of these lot do you?" he asked rhetorically knowing how proud Vernon was."hmm well I guess the list was more of a guideline anyway, we don't want these people to think they are better than us do we"Harry went to go and get his schoolbooks whilst the Dursleys went to the broom store to pick out a broom for Harry, getting his list out he started making his way through the many shelves of the store looking for the ones he needed."You wont find them over there" a voice came from behind him.Turning Harry saw the owner of the voice a girl with big bushy hair and teeth slightly too large for her own mouth. "You are looking for first year school books aren't you? I've already read the recommended books on the list of course I just came back here for some extra light reading" she continued on.Oh great she was one of those, too smart for their own good but not smart enough to realise people didn't like smart people. However no matter how annoying she would be people like her could be useful."Thanks I had no idea where I was looking" harry replied evenly "Did you come here often before you got your Hogwarts invitation?""Oh no! my parents are non magical, we were so surprised about when the letter arrived, My dad, he's a dentist, didn't believe it for a second the school had to send Professor McGonnagall to come and prove it!" she said all this in the space of a few second without breathing, this was going to be difficult."Yeah i suppose it must be quite a surprise for you" Harry replied trying to sound empathetic."Oh yes it really was but then McGonnagall turned into a cat right before our eyes, there was no way it was a trick or anything and I mean its quite impressive magic isn't it I looked it up in the books she must be a really powerful witch only a few people in the world are animagi"Did she ever shut up?"In fact not even Professor Dumbledore who most people say is the most powerful wizard in the world I mean he did defeat Grindelwald and even You know who was supposed to be scared of him!"That would be a no. Who was this You know who person though and Grindelwald?"I hear that Harry Potter is meant to be starting Hogwarts this year but he hasn't been seen since he defeated You know who when he was just a baby, of course some people say that it wasn't Harry who defeated him that he and James duelled and the draw killed both of them but they are just conspiracies really Dumbledore was one of the first to arrive and he seems to think it was Harry though he wont say how a baby could of beaten the most powerful dark lord alive""Yeah its pretty hard to believe" Harry replied thinking to himself he needed to learn all about the magical worlds history."So are your parents wizards then?" She asked switching subjects without a moments hesitation."Yes, but they are not very famous I'm afraid" he lied."I'm so worried that I will be rubbish compared to all the wizarding children i mean you have been learning about magic since you grew up and I've only just found out about it, its not fair is it" She sounded genuinely distraught, probably the thought of not knowing more than everyone else scaring her."Yes well about that if you study hard I'm sure no one will know you aren't from a magical family, Actually it would be a good idea if you pretend you are from a small magical family maybe from another country" Harry continued, now was the time to make an ally out of this girl."Why? I mean there's nothing wrong with being a" she hesitated " muggle is there?""No of course not" Harry said reassuring her "But some of the magical families don't like muggleborn children its best to just pretend you are one of them" Trying to explain in way she would understand "its a bit like how some British people see immigrants coming and taking what they think its theirs, its silly I know but sometimes its better to not make a target out of yourself""Hmm" she looked thoughtful "I Don't like it but i guess its a good idea atleast until i have caught up with them on magic" A look came over her face the sort of look a girl might get when she is going to save all the cute little animals in the world and change how everybody thinks. "maybe I could start a club for muggles, I could call it something like, Magical & Unmagicals Dismiss Beliefs Long Outdated & Ousting of Differences Society.""Good idea," Harry agreed "just wait till you are out of school to start it""mm hmm" clearly too busy dreaming about how she was going to change the world to hear Harry."So are we friends" Harry asked sticking his hand out.She looked surprised as if she had rarely heard the word before "Yes Yes of course we are, I'm Hermione Granger by the way""Harry Dursley, Pleased to meet you, I'll see you at school" he said shaking her hand."Goodbye Harry" she called to him as he went to get his books.Harry quickly found the books he would need for the year as well as a book on modern history of magical Britain in an attempt to pass off as a born wizard.He left the store and started walking to Quality quidditch supplies to meet back up with his family but was distracted walking past another shop."What on earth have you got Harry!?" came the shrill voice of Petunia as Harry left the store."Meet Hedgwig everyone" Harry gestured toward the Snowy owl in the cage he was carrying."Take that thing right back were you found it, its probably got rabies or something""But Mum the wizards don't have a normal postman! if I don't get an Owl I wont be able to write to you" Harry reasoned."There is no way that is coming home with us, I'm sure there is another way for you to send us letters without turning our house into an aviary" Petunia hated animals."There really isn't mum trust me I asked them, I don't want this ugly bird either but it would be so much worse to not speak to you until Christmas" Hedgwig gave harry an angry glare as he spoke."Oh Harry I'm going to miss you so much" Petunia was on the edge of tears and embraced Harry in the middle of the street "the bird can stay but it better not make a mess""Look son we got you a broom" Vernon declared giving Harry an opportunity to escape Petunia."they call it a Silver Star" Vernon declared seemingly very proud of his purchase "The shop keep said they are very rare because they are an older broom and when it comes to magic older is better or so I'm informed, Completely backwards the nutters!""Oh wow dad thanks!" Harry genuinely happy to have a broom the fact it was older even better he could say it was passed on to him from his grandfather."Well that's everything on your list once we have gotten you a wand, lets hurry up and get that done so we can return to the real world" Harry was so far quite impressed with his fathers behaviour usually if anyone did anything that he didn't understand it would quickly spark Vernon's anger but Vernon had managed to remain calm the entire time since leaving Gringotts only glaring at the various Witches and Wizards in their robes as they headed towards the wand shop, Olivanders.Entering the shop Harry looked around, it was a tall room with rows of boxes suspiciously like a shoe shop there was a ladder against a row of boxes but no one in the shop at all thinking the owner out for food Harry turned to leave."I've been wondering when you would come to see me Mr Potter" Came a strangely eerie voice as a elderly man appeared from the back of the shop."Sorry Sir I think you have me confused with someone else, its Dursley, Harry Dursley.""Is it how interesting Mr Dursley, I am of course Olivander" he said putting a strange inflection on his surname "Are you here for your wand choosing?" It seemed more of a statement than a question but Harry answered anyway."Yes sir, how does it work do I just pick a wand I like?""The wand will choose you Harry you will know when you have the right one" Olivander explained.Without a further word Olivander started to pick wands off of the shelves giving them to harry the first few he held the man snatched back from Harry before they had even touched his finger tips muttering under his breath the whole time. After a few minutes of this with dozens of discarded wands Harry was beginning to wonder if he would ever find a wand which would work for him."hmm I wonder, yes it might work" he heard Olivander mutter."What is it?""oh just a hunch lets see shall we" he continued cryptically reaching to one of the higher shelves for a case. reaching into the box he drew out a wand and handed it to Harry, immediately Harry could feel something different as he took hold of the wand almost a warm sensation in his hand."Holly eleven inches with a Phoenix feather core" The wizard told harry without being asked. "Go on then giving to a whirl"unsure what to do Harry waved the wand and gold sparks leapt from the wand. Harry's jaw dropped some part of him ever since being told about magic had not believed it was real but he had felt that it was no trick it was real.Olivander on the other hand had a slightly worried expression on his face."Whats wrong sir? isn't that a good thing?""Yes yes of course it is but so curious very curious indeed, Mr ... Dursley." Again the amused tone at Harry's name."Whats curious?""The phoenix that gave the feather in your wand Harry only gave one other feather. I remember that wand thirteen and a half inches made of yew but the curious thing is who that wand went to." The man could of been a host for a Quiz show he seemed to enjoy the suspense so much."yes that wand went to the boy who would become He Who Shall Not Be Named"Well that sounded ominous but was this the same unnamed man as You Know Who. If not wizards seemed to have a werid aversion to giving people names."Oh really, that is werid isn't it" Harry replied feigning understanding at how this was significant. "So can I buy this one?""It is the best match you will find, seven galleons Mr Dursley, how curious indeed."Harry paid the man and left almost too quickly he was getting the creeps from Mr Olivander he seemed to look at Harry as if he knew a secret.Meeting back up with the rest of his family who had opted to stay outside away from all the unnaturalness that was magic too them, They quickly made their way back out of Diagon Alley, passerbys often giving Harry a second glance before shaking their heads.It didn't take long for them to drive back to Privet Drive.The next few days could not have passed any quicker for Harry he filled his time reading as much of the background history of magic both from his history book which seemed almost entirely about goblin rebellions (it was surprising wizards trusted them to look after their money with the number of wars fought) and his modern history book which described in brief detail the rise and fall of Grindlewald and a more in depth account of You Know Who, but still Harry had no idea what this mans real name was. His downfall was seemingly caused by a baby known as the boy who lived or Harry Potter but had not been seen since he defeated the Dark Lord and some even speculated that he didn't really survive the fight.He tried to test out his silver star but had no idea how it worked it seemed like just a normal broom to him a pity it didn't come with an instruction manual.The day he would go to school soon arrived, a teary eyed Petunia was packing Harry's things acting as if someone had died and soon they left for the train station. One thing had puzzled Harry about the instructions it had said the train would be on a platform nine and three quarters but he was sure that was not a real platform. They arrived at the station and stood between platforms nine and ten."They couldn't just have a normal train" Vernon complained "they had to do another disappearing brick wall trick or some other nonsense show-offs""I guess we will just have to wait for someone to show us how to get through dad""Hmphh! we will see about that!" Vernon declared strolling over to the brick archway reaching out to poke the wall but as soon as he touched the wall his hand seemed to go inside of it. "haha easy""Oh harry I'm going to miss you so much" Petunia sobbed giving harry a wet kiss on the cheekThey said there goodbyes but Hedgwig was starting draw attention after all Owls were not common pets, and so Harry bravely strolled toward the barrier "I'll meet you back here for christmas" he smiled stepping through the barrier.Lucius Malfoy had not been idle since his 'accidental' meeting with the Dursleys, they had unwittingly given him permission to use magic on the boy hopefully bypassing any of the protections Dumbledore had placed on the child and he could now get rid of the boy and he had heard of just the way to do it without it being possibly linked to him.Harry came out of the Barrier with a odd feeling like he had travelled a lot further than a few steps, in fact looking around everything felt wrong but there he was on a platform clearly surrounded by obviously magical people.AN thankyou for reading not really alot happening in this chapter i mainly wanted it to show the differences to how my Harry interacts with characters compared to canon Harry, for anyone who is wondering Olivander goes along with harry on the dursley thing thinking its a cover to avoid the press/fans.
