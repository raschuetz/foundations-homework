Written for Scavenger Hunt Challenge (a fic under 100 words)There was a great many things Draco regretted. The list was longer than he would care to admit, but he tried not to dwell on it so much these days. He had made mistake after mistake, but none of this matter now.Standing in the park, watching as his son ran about, trying to catch falling snow on his tongue, Draco couldn't think of a better life. He had made a disgrace of his name, but watching his kid, in all his innocents, Draco was positive that Scorpius would be better then he had ever been.
