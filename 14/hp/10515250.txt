Hello guys! This is Kyla and Daniela. The authors of A Big Mistake. As you can see, this will be a Harmione fanfiction. We are not quite satisfied of how the ending went. We really are a big Harry and Hermione fans so we decided to make this fanfiction. All credits and characters go to J.K. Rowling, the amazing Harry Potter author. All ideas amd events are based on our imagination. Thank you!
