Hermione wasn't prepared for what was to come. Minerva (As Hermione was now allowed to call her) had asked her to do one of the biggest things in history, especially since it would end up changing history. Hermione was asked to go back in time and defeat Voldemort, who was known back then as Tom Riddle. Hermione had to make a choice. She had lost so many of her friends during the battle, Harry included. Dumbledore had been killed a year before by Snape. That bastard, Hermione thought. He was friends with Dumbledore and he betrayed him. How could he have been such a good friend of Dumbledore but still had the will to kill him? Hermione had been furious with Snape ever since. Hermione knew what had to be done. She realized that there was no point in staying here with all of her friends dead. She would make Voldemort pay, and she didn't care how. Oh yes, she would go back in time and kill Tom Riddle. She would save so many lives, including Harry's parents. What must be done, what must be done, Hermione thought. She packed all of her belongings (which wasn't very much) and went up to Minerva. "Minerva, I've made my choice...I'm going back in time and I'm going to defeat Voldemort."
