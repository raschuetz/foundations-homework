They couldn't be seeing the same girl as he did, because then how could they call her plain and jeer at her 'buckteeth'? How could they mock her 'bushy' hair?Harry loved how natural Hermione was. It fascinated him how, whenever she was passionate about something, her curls would dance. He admired how she didn't need make up to catch someone's attention; a smile  with perfect teeth - was enough.Harry sometimes mused if he was the only person who saw these things.And he resolved to tell Hermione how beautiful she was every single day.
