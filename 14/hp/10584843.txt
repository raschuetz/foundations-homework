PrologueHarry Potter was collecting money from his Gringotts vault when he discovered his family vault. It wasn't long after the war ended, and he needed money as he was no longer living in a tent. The goblins, though still wary of him, gave him a second key. Harry had wondered why his first vault didn't have any relics or valuables, like Bellatrix's vault. He discovered that the vault he had originally had access to was only a trust vault.But when he entered the Potter family vault, he realized that his family's fortune was much more extensive. The goblins stood impatiently at the door while Harry wandered through the room, staring all around. There were suits of armor standing guard by chests and tables staked up with vases and trophies. It was so much to take in, Harry was in a daze. He didn't know what to look at.Harry looked through a couple chests, finding more gold in various forms, some jewelry and a few old, worn books. Finally he picked up a small but ornate box, somewhat in the middle of the vault. Inside was a much newer book but no less ornate. Most interestingly, his name was embossed on the cover, along with his date of birth.But just as he was about to open it, he heard the goblins shifting impatiently at the door. Deciding that he had kept them waiting long enough, Harry hastily dropped some money into his pouch, and tucked the book under his arm. He could come back later, perhaps with Hermione, who he knew would be interested in the old books.-Section Break-Harry, back at Grimmauld Place, sat down in an armchair by the fire. He finally had some time by himself, and he was still curious about the book he had found in the vault. Relaxing further into the chair, Harry picked up the book, and opened it up to the first page. At first he only took in the style. It was handwritten, with a date at the top, like a diary. But then Harry sucked in a surprised breath, because he recognized the handwriting
