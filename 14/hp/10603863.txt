Hey guys. So, I thought I'd give drabbles a go. I know this is short. Give them a chance to get longer. Now, if you could, could you please request ones for me to write. Suggest a pairing and theme. The pairing doesn't have to be romantic, and in fact, if you don't want them to be romantic, let me know. :-)It had been a rollercoaster of emotions for Lily. She had just discovered as much as James infuriated her, she loved him. "James Potter, I will never go out with you!" She was silenced by the tall boys lips on hers. She closed her eyes and gave up, kissing him back.
