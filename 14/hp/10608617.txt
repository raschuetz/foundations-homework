Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. I wish I did though. Recess was a time for fun and games, playing tag, or climbing the monkey bars. But not for 9 year old Harry Potter. No, for him, recess was a time for pain, and fear. Recess was a time for 'Harry-Hunting'.Harry-Hunting was a favorite past time for Harry's whale of a cousin Dudley and his friends, where they would chase Harry around either town, or the playground, and when they caught him, they would beat him to a pulp.So as you can imagine, each minute ticking down until recess made Harry more and more terrified. When the bell rang, he was practically shaking with fear.The entire class began to file out the door and onto the playground, and as soon as he was out of the building, he took off running, hoping to get a head start.After about 10 minutes of straight out sprinting, Harry started to slow down and slowly but surely, he began hear the shouts and cries of Dudley and his friends.Oh no! He thought, as the group of people came into view. I have to get out of here! Suddenly, they caught him, shoving him to the ground, delivering kicks and punches to every part of his body available.Pain. So much pain. Harry's mind began to drift, and just before he was enveloped into darkness, he had one last coherent thought. Please, get me out of here.Right after he lost conciseness, there came a great pop, and Harry disappeared into thin air, never to be seen for a long, long, time.Okay, so this is my attempt at a fanfiction. I would like any feedback that you can give me, point out any flaws, or things that are actually pretty good, any comments are worth something. Tell me if you actually think that I should continue with this story. Thanks! Don't forget to follow and favorite! (Or not, you know, I'm not controlling you)
