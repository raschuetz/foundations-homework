Disclaimer: I do not own anything from Harry Potter; all right's go to J.K. Rowling. I make no money for this fiction writing and never will.AN: I know I'm not the greatest of writers so if there are any major mistakes that you see just tell me and I will try to fix itand on to the storyPrologueAdrian Potter the boy who lived is well loved and cared for gets whatever his heart desires and is always in the spot light. While not many know this Adrian has a twin brother that is very neglected and abused Harry Potter. The only people thatreally know that he exists are Sirius and Remus. Sirius black and Remus Lupine are great friends of the Potter have been sense they began school together all at different times though but throughout the past few years they have been drifting apart with all the fame going through the Potter heads. The only reason that they have stayed friends with them is for Harry's sake as they know about the abuse that Harry has to go through each day and want to take him out of the Potter's care but can't as the courts would not allow that to happen. They would just side with the Potter to leave Harry in their custody.AN: again I know I'm not the greatest writer so all comments are welcome good or bad
