Chapter 1I was so excited for today was my 11th birthday, today I received my Hogwarts acceptance letter. I was going to Hogwarts. I was finally joining my cousins. I was finally sure. I was finally in.My Hogwarts letter also contained a pen pal number. The letter said 'This year we are trying out a new scheme. Each new child starting in the September of 2017 has been given a pen pal. Through a special charm each child was randomly paired up, at the bottom of this letter is a number, this is the unique number of your pen pal, do not lose this number.You are expected to contact your pen pal at least once before school starts. The number you have been given is recognized by owls so there is no need for an address on your letters.Pen pal number:1931518169152119'So now I was even more excited, I was off to Hogwarts and I had a pen pal who was in my year and may possibly be my first non cousin/ family friend at Hogwarts. So being my mother's daughter I got started on a letter straight away.
