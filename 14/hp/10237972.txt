They said they had been training him. They said they had been raising him. They lied. They did not see the blood. They did not hear the screams. His eyes were always empty. He died. That's how he won. Now maybe he can find the part of him he had lost. Maybe now his eyes won't be as empty.  I closed his corpses. I buried him. They said he was a hero. They said he was valiant. They said he died in honor. They lied. It died a weapon.
