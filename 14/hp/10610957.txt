Mudblood. It's been a year since I called her it. No matter how many times I've said sorry, she doesn't get it. And honestly, I think she's close to falling for that Potter boy. She won't forgive me. No matter what I do. Lily always has a way of avoiding me, coming up with an excuse. And Potter, along with his insane gang, always finds a way of torturing me.I really miss Lily. I've started hanging around Lucius Malfoy and his friends. They're going to turn me into a Death Eater like them, I know it. Lily has heard about it, and she just believes that what's happening proves that I meant what I said to her."Lily!" I called down the hallway. "Lily! Lily, please wait. Please, you have to listen. Just wait!""No, Sev." She still called me Sev. I'm surprised she hasn't started named me Snivellus. "No, you listen. Your mind is all all corrupted! This isn't you. Now go take a bath you greasy-haired Neanderthal." I watched her rosy curls storm away.I sulked back to my common room and looked out the window into the mulky depths of the lake.
