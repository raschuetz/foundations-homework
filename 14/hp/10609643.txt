His eyes tracked her every movement.She stepped in front of the window above the sink, looked at him and smiled. Her hair blew in the gentle breeze from the open windows. She looked angelic. She opened her mouth to speak, but he cut her off."Freeze. Stop right there. I want to remember this moment forever."
