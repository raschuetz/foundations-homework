He ran. More than once the green light missed him by an inch. But he didn't care. He would have stepped back an inch to be hit by the curse if that would have meant staying with Marlene, wherever she would go. He dropped himself beside her. He took her in his arms and held her head carefully. She was pale. Her eyes were open, but she wasn't blinking. He cried for help. But no one would hear him. Remus was dueling against Greyback. Mad-Eye had his wand pointing at six death eaters, each one getting their turn. Lily was fighting and healing at the same time. None of them seemed to notice that one of them fell.

He ran, whispering to her that she will be alright. That they will both go back home, that he will make her another cup of coffee. That from now he will make her one every morning until his last heartbeat if she lets him. He promises her that he will take care of her, that one day he will propose to her. He promises that even after she slaps him, he will keep proposing her again and again, until she says yes. Because he could never bear having that feeling, as he holds her in his arms as if she was his own, again. He could never bear having to be torn again by the idea that he might lose her before even doing what he had always wanted to do with her, before telling her how much he loved her, before even saying good bye./pp style="outline: none 0px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); margin: 0px 0px 10px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', HelveticaNeue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19.600000381469727px;"They finally reached St Mungo, and she was torn off from his arms. Now he was pacing, runnign both of his fists in his hands fiercly, punching walls. He was wondering, if he had done something different this morning, would it be different? What if he had stayed a little longer, until he had resolved himself to stay with her and never go on mission? what if he had kissed her a little wilder, she would have woken up and dragged him back with her under the blankets? what if he had made a better coffee, she would have enjoyed it and stayed home instead of leaving the cup cooling down and storming out to find him?

On the next second, he had entered Marlene's room. There she was, sitting upright on her bed, staring into the depths as if her thoughts were written on the blankets.
