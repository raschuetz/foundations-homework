Do I look like I own HP if I did Hermione would marry Draco. By the way the was a disclaimer.Disclaimer: Sadly I do not own Harry Potter or Tom Felton.Just to tell you so there are no questions 1. Ginny is in the same year as Hermione, Luna and Lavender 2. Hermione never met Harry and Ron on the train so there not friends 3. Draco, Ron, Harry and Neville are friends4. Neville is popular 5. They basically rule Hogwarts Thats it for now if there is anymore I'll let you know.Smartcat101 " Doe Ray Me Fa -" Ginny's singing was interrupted by Hermione threatening to hex them if they don't shut up. " PLEASE SHUT UP AND LET ME SLEEP" Hermione screamed at Ginny and Lavender who where singing scales at different octaves. " We won't stop until you get up Mione." Lavender said while jumping on her bed, Hermione got up and muttered a simple dress up spell and her pjs melted into a fitting white top, black skirt that ended just above her knees, gryfindor tie, her Mary Janes and her robe. Hermione walked into the washroom brushed her hair, washed her face and brushed her teeth. " Hurry up theres only 15 mins left of breakfast." Ginny reminded her, I walked out of the washroom as Ginny handed me my books. " thanks." Hermione, Ginny and Lavender walked down to the common room and saw Luna " There you are you took forever." " Sorry some of us wouldn't get up." Ginny said and pointedly looked at me.I blushed and looked down " Sorry Gin, you know I'm not a morning person.""Yah I learnt that the hard way." We all laughed remembering the moment when Ginny woke Hermione up and the next day she dropped water balloons on her head and charmed her sheets to ice. " Come on I'm hungry let's go to the great hall."That morning is when those 4 girls where amazing.OK it's not amazing but review and tell me if I should continue.
