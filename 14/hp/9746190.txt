Chapter 1: Jealousy"Lily"The redhead hummed in recognition but made no move to look away from the two people sitting a few tables away from them.Marlene let out a sigh of frustration "Lily, you're staring again, it's not like the is stupid enough to cheat on his girlfriend right in front of her, besides, James doesn't even look that much interested in her. He's only doing it because McGonagall asked him to, it's not like he volunteered"Lily rolled her eyes at her best friend's intervention , it is not like she thinks James will cheat on her, she knows he won't but still it's hard to see her boyfriend being hit on by some less than adequate sixth year who she is positively suredoesn't even have as much trouble with transfiguration as she is claiming.She had tried to keep them company but James had seen right through her and had politely and discretely told her to leave which made Lily fume even more. What did that girl have that she didn't? "I just don't get why he told me to go away" Lily said looking defeated."He didn't threw you out, you were just all over him, it was a pure display of jealousy, how could he concentrate when you were always running your hands through his hair? The guy was having a hard time just to answer the simplest question. When he finishes he'll come see you"Two hours later Marlene's prediction came true and their study session ended and James made his way towards them."Hello ladies" he greeted them as he sat down next to Lily and gave her a quick peck on the cheek, instantly noticing the foul mood she was on. "Come on love you can't get mad at me, I was just helping her!" He said putting his arm around her shoulders and kissing her temple.Lily sighed "I know, I just don't like watching girls throwing themselves at you" she pouted as she snuggled closer and started his jaw and down his neck "you're mine, and mine only"At this point Marlene had already left, sick of all the lovey-gooey stuff. As of Lily and James, they stayed in the library kissing until it all became too much and the headed back to their head's dormitory.A/N:This is my first fanfiction ever so be kind please :) I'll be updating whenever I feel like writing, if you want to know when that's going to happen follow me on .com or just track the tag Jily and there will be some news coming up someday.Feel free to send some prompts you want to see written :)
