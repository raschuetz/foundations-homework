They were disappearing. Disappearing from Malfoy Manor, from danger, from Voldemort himself maybe they had arrived at their destination. Wait. Hermione felt that something was wrong, dreadfully wrong. There was a hand on her wrist! As Hermione looked back, she screamed. Bellatrix was right behind her! Bellatrix grinned evilly, then said, "Stupefy!"Hermione opened her eyes. She groaned. Hermione raised her hand to rub her eyes when she discovered that they were chained to the back of the chair. She struggled against the chains binding her, but it was no use. She sighed. Oh well, she thought. At least I'm not dead. Suddenly, footsteps sounded. The door opened, and in came Bellatrix. Hermione tensed. It was obvious that Bellatrix noticed, for she said sweetly, "There's no need to be scared. As long as you say the truth, nothing will happen to you." "Yeah, right," said Hermione bravely, disguising the fear she felt. "If I tell you everything, then you'll let me off the hook and go back, huh?" Bellatrix's mouth tightened, though she said, in the same sweet tone, "Oh, itty bitty little baby isn't going to talk, isn't she?" Bellatrix took out her wand. "This ought to loosen your tongue." Bellatrix pointed her wand at Hermione, then said, "Crucio!" Hermione screamed, the sound echoing off the walls. "Ready to talk?" said Bellatrix coldly. "Face it, nobody's going to hear you, and we've got hours ahead of us"While Hermione was at Malfoy Manor, Harry and Ron were at Shell Cottage, planning what to do next. A fist pounded on the table. "What the hell are we supposed to do?" said Ron angrily. "We're practically dead without her!" "Calm down, Ron," said Bill disapprovingly. "I'm sure we can find a way to rescue Hermione from Malfoy Manor." "Yes," said Fleur. "Ve vill find a vay."However, Bill was wrong. They spent fruitless hours, discussing plans, brainstorming, talking about what to do next was best. Nothing came to their minds.
