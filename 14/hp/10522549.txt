Warning! This includes Characters coming back from the dead, Character death, 'time travel', changes in personalities, smart Harry, smart characters, extreme anger and jealously (for Dean and Lavender), soul bondings, Hinny, Romione, Nuna, Draco and Astoria pairings, bad Lavender, bad Dean, Sirius/Amelia Bones, Remus/Tonks, James/Lily, Dumbledore/McGonagall, pet snake, horcrux hunting, Petunia/Severus, andmany others! If you don't have an interest in any of these, I suggest you not read this story!Before comenting on how much of an ass this Harry is, I would apriciate it if you would continue reading! Hopefully he will get better after Chapter 6!I also note that people think of how awful snape was compared to James and Sirius and it is noted Harry eyes will metaphorically open to this fact as well. As for how weak willed I made Sirius, and others, because of Harry's rage. Sirius was just afraid of losing the one thing he had left of James at the time so he broke easily.I MUST WARN YOU! EXTREME MARAUDER BASHING UNTIL CHAPTER 6(if all goes as planned) PLEASE CONTINUE READING AND STOP AFTER 6 IF YOU STILL HATE MY STORY!(Warning doesn't count as Chapter)
