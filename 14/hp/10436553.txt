A screamedI finally found a compartment with a red haired boy and a boy with messy long brown hair and glasses.I slowly opened the door."May I please join you?"The red haired boy gestured me into the compartment.The other boy looked up at me with a smile.I recognized his scar on his temple." you are Harry Potter! I read about you in Wizards of the Century"The compartment door open quickly and a taller red haired boy stepped in." oh hello, I am Fred."This boy looked awfully a lot like the boy who was already in the compartment."My name is Hermione" I said as kindly as possible."Ron, come help us find a boy's toad."I assumed that Ron must have been the shorter red head"I don't care about the stupid toad" Ron said with a whinny attitudeI jumped up out of my seat "I'll help"We walked out the compartment.I looked up at his face, he had so many feckles.I think I am starting to fancy him, the way his hair flowed, he look gentle and kind.Fred's POVHermione was walking along side me trying to help me find the toad.I looked down at her, her hair was long and brown.She had such an innocent face.I think I might fancy her.But I can't, she is a first year!Could you imagine George, he would never let me forget it.Hermione's POVFred led me into a compartment with several boys.There was one who looked exactly like Fred.They must be twins.Fred's twin stood up and stuck his hand out " I am George"I put at my hand and shook his "nice to meet you"I felt strange in that compartment, everyone was staring at me so I turned to Fred and said " I am going to look for that toad, I'll see you at the feast."I started for the door.He yelled after me "yeah see you then, I hope you get Griffindor! I'll save you a seat at our table."I left and went to go look for the toad.
