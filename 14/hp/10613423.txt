Please read; this is important!Now, I think we all know what a Mary Sue is. If not, please go look it up, because I'm far too lazy to explain.Well, I'm starting something called the Mary Sue Challenge. I don't know if it's been done before, but I'm just calling it that for now.So basically, what I'm going to do is make as Mary Sue of an OC as I can, than try to write as good of a fanfiction as I can, even with all the Mary Sue-ish crap. So for this little experiment, I'm writing a Harry Potter fanfiction! :)I'm still working out everything, so it might take a while before the first part of the story is out. But I'm pretty excited about this! I hope you guys like this idea, and wish me luck!I'll need it!~Loree
