A/N: Hello there; welcome to my collection :)Just a quick disclaimer for the whole collection that I don't own anything in the Harry Potter franchise nor am I making any profit from this.As said in the summary there will be various genres and timelines within here. There may be AU or EWE from time to time but I'll put warnings on individual drabbles for those.This first one was inspired by Paparazzi by Lady GaGa (don't own that either)Happy reading!Paparazzi Click! Hermione and Draco broke apart at the noise. Draco groaned, "You have got to be kidding me!""How did she find us here?!" Hermione tried to whisper as her eyes darted around the trees in the Forest of Dean."Maybe she was a Hufflepuff," Draco muttered. Hermione elbowed him in the ribs, causing him to make a low ooph! sound.'"This is no time for jokes. I swear that woman is stalking us.""Let Skeeter have her moment, I'm sure our relationship is the biggest news story right now." Draco laughed, as he moved to kiss Hermione again.She pulled away, "Are you serious? I'm sure there are more pressing things to be reporting about.""Not really; Voldemort's dead now. Let's face it, all the Prophet cared about was him and escaped Death Eaters and Potter." Draco shrugged."Hmph," Hermione huffed, "still, this is beginning to feel like an invasion of privacy.""Relax, it's not like she's been spying on us everyday in the-""Will. You. Be. Quiet." Hermione punctuated each word with a light punch on Draco's arm, "As if that woman needs more ideas."Draco merely smirked, "I'm sorry okay?""Hmm. You know, maybe we've got this all wrong and it's really you she's interested in, not us. She might have a shrine at home full of pictures of you." Hermione said, laughing out loud when Draco's smirk fell from his face,"Well played, Granger," he said, kissing her again.Click!A/N: Feel free to leave a review with an idea if you'd like a drabble written for you :)
