Dear readers, this is the continuation of HP series, starting with Albus Potter and his friends and family; James, Rose, and my oc, Shadow. The pairings are: Albus Potter/ Shadow, James/Rose. Read and enjoy, thx. ;)ALBUSThe train left the platform. Soon Albus was left staring at the cloud of smoke that rose from his family's hidden forms.It doesn't matter to us, his father'd said. But if it worries you, the hat takes your choices to help decide.He felt a little better. At least he was born into a pure  blood wizard family."Hey," Rose says, nudging him. "Albus? Merlin, Albus, you musn't lose focus like that!" Albus' eyes focused on Rose's red hair, as this was the easiest to focus on."Sorry, Rose," he murmured embarassedly, turning away. Her eyes softened. Albus still couldn't believe they were cousins.They were so different, the two of them. Rose was a half-blood, she was bold, daring, and smart. He, on the other hand, was pureblood; he thought things through before acting. Both of them had red hair, although Rose's was redder, while Albus' was flame red.His father had the same green eyes as him, though. James, his older brother, didn't even have the green eyes. Apparently, the flame red Weasly look was very un  rare.Albus let his eyes wander around their compartment a little. He looked at all the pureblooded, who were easily distinguished from their Hogwarts Robes, and his gaze fell upon a beautiful strawberry  blonde girl, who was sitting in the corner, gazing around.She looked at him, her indigo and yellow flecked eyes landing on his green eyes.She seemed to recognize him. Albus walked over to her."Hello," he said placidly. "I see you were looking at me, and I decided to introduce myself. My name is Albus, Albus Severus Potter. May I help you?" The girl stared at him. Her eyes were steely and cold. "No, thanks," she answered, her voice silvery. "My name is Shadow, Shadow Rosemary. Nice to meet you."
