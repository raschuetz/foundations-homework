Harry Potter, Phoenix King: A Harry Potter Fan FictionDisclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter or any of its associated characters; all rights belong to JK Rowling; I also do not own any references made to other fandoms; all rights go to their original creators; I do own any OC spells explained at the end of a chapter.Plot: Cross-Response to my 'Elemental Harry' Challenge: When Harry was bitten by the Basilisk and revived by Fawkes, an age-old prophecy was set in motion surrounding our hero; now with new powers, new allies and a new future, can Harry overcome his enemies to emerge victorious in his life?Author's Note: Okay, so this one came to me as a different sort of story, but with a few tweaks, I have this idea in motion: now, despite being a challenge response to my 'Elemental Harry' Challenge, I should also say that it holds options from my 'A Sirius Secret' Challenge hence why I call this one a cross-response.I'll put in all of the challenge details before getting into the story so that you can see what I mean, but I hope it makes it easy for you to understand and follow along; and, as always, though I'm actually starting to hate having to say it; if you don't like it, then don't read it.Challenge Information: Okay, so here are the challenges and the things that you'll find in the story: apologies to anyone who thinks this is just a waste, but I need to understand myself as well as help my readers understand what the story's aboutELEMENTAL HARRY CHALLENGE: When Harry decides to look into his magic - or discovers it as a child - he finds he can command one or more of the elemental forces.Rules: Harry must discover his power in 5th Year or earlier  as most stories I've read have Harry discovering such powers AFTER 5th year: 3rd yearHarry can be ANY alignment: Light, Grey, Neutral, Dark or Evil!
