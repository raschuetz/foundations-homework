Thank you so much to every reader who has followed this story for the last few years. Many people have decided that I have given up and moved on, I haven't. As I have grown and learned, going through various college classes, I have honed my writing craft. while not perfect, it is much better. In story One you will want to read it over. Things have changed, a lot, and the entire second book 'Bk' has been restricted, rewritten, and totally revamped. I have rewritten the first part of the story twice in the last few years. The re-writes are done and the writing will continue.I am incredibly Thankful to every reader, I still get a review update from time to time, and I am very thankful. I am humbled that you take time to read this work, let alone review it. There is so much better written and better planned fanfiction, and every second you choose to read mine makes me so happy. I will leave this author note up for one week (Until 8/17/2014) as a courtesy so every one has a chance to read it, at which time I will delete this story for good.Thank YouMarioTobler
