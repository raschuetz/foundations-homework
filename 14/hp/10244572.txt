Hi! Very first one. Draco/Hermione. Which pairing do you want me to do a little one shot on next? It can be canon or not: everything from Hinny to Lumione. You get to choose if you like. If you post a request in your review I'll happily write it for you.Pairing: Draco/HermioneDraco has never looked into her eyes. If he does, he will lose himself.He loves the way her hair never falls straight. He loves the way she calls him those imaginative names. He loves her sweet perfumed smell, and her awful dress sense. He loves the way she makes him so angry, that he wants to cry. And he loves the way his cheek tingles ever since she slapped him.It's not enough to love all those things though.He has to look into her eyes. And he can't because he will realise that she doesn't love him.But one day...So, as he watches everything burn around him, clinging onto the broomstick of Harry Potter, loving her: he looks into her eyes.And all he can see is hate.
