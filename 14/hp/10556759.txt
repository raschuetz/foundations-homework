Chapter 1The choice.Ginnys POVI look at my mother with tears in my eyes, this was not a choice that I ever wanted to make, I had my life planned out, I would play for the Holyhead harpies, i would get married to Harry, my childhood crush/boyfriend, have kids, a whole life that I am throwing away. I, as well as Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred and George, have just completed my last year at hogwarts. I am numbing out the voices, trying not to cry. Hermione walks up to the front, so I can only assume that her name has been called. She turns to the village, away from the boat, and walks forward, it is the last time I will ever see her face. My eyes are glazed over with tears as more and more people walk up. Malfoy chooses to stay behind, which surprises me, surely he, of all people, would want to escape. Luna leaves, then harry, both opting for the boat, and before long its my go. Fred and George have already been called, and both of them have left, I can't believe im doing this. I bite my lip until it draws blood, and stifle a sob, its my choice, and my loss, if I stay l lose my brothers, my boyfriend. If I go, I lose my mother, my best friend. I turn to the boat, i cant do this, I can't do this. But apparently I can, since istep cautiously onto the boat, where I break down and cry.
