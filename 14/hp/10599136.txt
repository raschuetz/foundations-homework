Who is Owen Cauldwell?Pairing: Owen Cauldwell/Rose ZellerWord Count: 183Prompt: Involve you character in a romantic relationshipDisclaimer: Don't own 'em - not making any money off 'em. Dern it.Note: Just so you know, Owen Cauldwell was a Hufflepuff sorted in 1994 (Harry's 4th year). That's all that's known about him. Also, Rose Zeller was a Hufflepuff sorted a year later than Owen.Owen might be a Hufflepuff, but he wasn't what one would call a traditional Hufflepuff. He was nowhere near as mean and disloyal as Zacharias Smith. In fact, Owen hated Zacharias. He thought the older wizard was a disgrace to the Hufflepuff house. So although he believed in loyalty and hard work, it wasn't Owen's dream to fall in love and raise a family. He wanted to make something of his life. He wanted to bring pride to the Cauldwell name. Some people might say that should have made him a Slytherin, what with all of that ambition.So imagine his surprise when he found his mind and heart completely occupied by one Rose Zeller, a Hufflepuff a year younger than him. She was all he could think about. She had beautiful chestnut hair that fell to her chin and curled just right, smoky grey eyes, a pert nose, and a perfect mouth.He still remembers his ultimate humiliation when he stuttered while asking her to attend Hogsmeade weekend with him. Thankfully, she said 'yes.'And as they say, the rest is history.
