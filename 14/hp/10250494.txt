She was always there. That niggling feeling right under the skin, always knowing when she was nearby. It infuriated him. To know that she, Hermione fucking Granger, could affect him like this."Love", Blaise called it. Love was for fools. It was a waste of time. But she...No. He has to stop thinking about her. It does no good to obsess over the idea.But she walks out the Great Hall and it's all he can do to stay in his seat and not follow her, to not pin her against a wall and snog her senseless, to not whisper little words of affection.."Draco!""What?", he said, responding to Blaise."I've been trying to get your attention for the last five minutes, mate. What's the matter? Granger got your knickers in a twist again?", Blaise said."Shut your mouth. I have better things to do than to stare at a Mu...at her. I'm finished eating, I'm going.""You can't even call her a Mudblood anymore, how romantic. You should try to find her. Maybe if you get a quick fuck you'll quit being such a bitch." Blaise goaded."Don't fucking talk about her like that!" Draco seethed."Ahhhh, looks like I hit a nerve. I win." Blaise said, grinning."Whatever, I'm out of here." Draco said, as he stood up to leave."And Draco, remember what I said, you know, earlier?

Was it worth it? Should he even bother? No, love is a waste of time. Or is it? How would he know? He'd never been in love before, but then again no one had ever affected him like she could.His decision being made, he entered the library and walked straight to the back, knowing he'd find her there.'here goes nothing', he thought."Granger.."
