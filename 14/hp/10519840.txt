Destiny's Light by Child of DreamsSummary: Alternate Universe! Alessandra Lilith Potter wakes up on her sixteenth birthday to some highly unexpected and completely shocking changes.And, as if it wasn't hard enough finding out she's a member of a mysterious race that is widely believed to be mere legend, Lys also has to deal with her new status as Princess of said race, as well as being mated to an extremely overprotective werewolf.Add in manipulative headmasters and evil dark lords, not to mention devastating betrayals from people she thought she could trust, and Lys is about to experience the adventure of a lifetime!Inspiration for this story comes directly from The Rise of the Drackens by Starlight Massacre and Sarkany Secrets by Sunset on Heartache!Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter.If I did, Harry would be female and Remus would have married her instead of Nymphadora Tonks.Chapter One: Birthday SurpriseAlessandra Lilith Potter let out a soft moan as she slowly drifted into consciousness on the morning of her 16th birthday.Every muscle, bone, joint and tendon in her body ached.Gingerly sitting up, she winced as pain shot through her back and slowly got to her feet.Stumbling painfully towards the door, Lys suddenly became aware that she wasn't wearing her glasses and yet, could see everything with 100% clarity.She moved silently through the hall and immediately caught sight of her reflection in the mirror upon entering the tiny bathroom.Lys gasped in shock at the changes her body had gone through overnight.Her eyes were a deeper, more intense shade of emerald and almost seemed to glow with a strange inner light.She had long, dark eyelashes, high cheekbones and a gently sloping nose that was placed perfectly over full, slightly pouty lips.Her previously, straight, mid-back length raven-black hair was now two or three shades darker with deep reddish highlights and fell to her waist in gentle, flowing waves.Her once pale, creamy skin now bore a natural tan that most of the girls at Hogwarts would kill for and her hips were slimmer and dare she say, curvier.Not a freckle or scar marred the sun-kissed flesh and Lys sighed happily.She was beautiful.Suddenly catching sight of a glint of silver underneath the edge of her right sleeve, Lys carefully removed her nightgown for a better look, exposing a tiny silver birthmark in the shape of a star inside a crescent moon.Twirling around, her eyes grew wide as she saw a pair of golden tattoos covering her back in some strange sort of intricate design.Wondering if she had gone through any other changes, the newly-turned 16 year old suddenly felt a light tingling sensation behind her shoulder blades right before a pair of iridescent butterfly wings with a mother of pearl sheen burst from her back.Lys gasped in awe, admiring her beautiful new appendages.Suddenly, she heard a sleepy grunt from across the hall and quickly pulled her nightgown back on before hurrying silently back down the hall and into her bedroom.Flopping onto the bed, Lys sighed deeply and buried her face in the thin, musty gray blanket that the Dursleys had given to her for use as a makeshift bedspread."What am I?" the raven-haired girl wondered curiously.Grabbing a large, leather bound book titled 'Creatures of Myth and Legend: A Guide for the Newly-Inherited Witch or Wizard,' she started frantically flipping through the pages in a desperate search for answers as to what she'd become."Drackens...Dragels...Drakes...Dryads...Elves..." Lys murmured as she turned the pages.Suddenly she stopped at a page with a sketch of a beautiful female with wings similar to Lys' own and a pair of tattoos identical to the ones on Lys' back.FAERIE, ELEMENTALElemental Faeries are the most powerful of all the Fair Folk.Generally humanoid in appearance with iridescent wings similar in appearance to those of butterflies and elemental tattoos on their backs, Elemental Faeries have full control over all four elements.While Elemental Faeries were once found all over the world, it has been five hundred years since the last reported/verified sighting of an Elemental Faerie and they are now widely believed to be mere legend.Lys closed the book, her mind whirling in a haze of shock and disbelief.She was a Faerie, an Elemental Faerie, which was believed to be pure myth and fantasy!Why did everything even remotely freakish always seem to happen to her?Author's Note: So, what do you think?Like it? Hate it? Don't know, but still interested in seeing where it goes?Leave a review and tell me your thoughts!P.S. As for Rising Sun, I have decided not to delete or rewrite it, but it may still take a while for my creative muse, now named Pandora, to get off her lazy butt and start inspiring me again!Until that happens, updates, for all my unfinished stories, may be several months apart.
