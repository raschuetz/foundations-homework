Disclaimer: I do not own the Harry Potter series or the characters, all credit goes to JK Rowling.It was the beginning of the Christmas holidays and Hermione was found pacing impatiently in the living room. She had invited Harry and Ron to her house, what with Harry's anger at Sirius Black and Ron's lack of muggle experience (unless you include driving the Ford Anglia) she thought that it would be better if they both had a more refreshing day to experience, especially if it would ease Harry's mind off all his worries and anger.Hermione glanced outside her foggy window, it had been snowing heavily the other day when she had received an owl from Ron saying that he and Harry would arrive at one o'clock by side-along-appiration from Mr Weasley. While the snow had receded, there was still an occasional snowflake that would fall from the sky. The scenery that was painted outside the window was one of pure white, all the houses, front lawns and streets were lined with snow and the road had a thin layer of ice on it.A ring of the doorbell startled Hermione, before she slowly started to smile, she raced to the door and opened it. There was Mr Weasley, Harry and Ron, just gazing at the three brought a spark of excitement in her stomach."Hi" she said cheerfully "oh I'm glad your here! I've been looking forward to today for a while now." Each figure had snow sprinkled on top of their head and a pink blush on their cheeks from the cold air."I wouldn't be surprised by that" Mr Weasley replied before either of the boys could open their mouths. "A full day doing muggle things," he smiled wistfully at the three kids "well you three have fun now and tell me everything that happens! I'll be coming for you and Harry at around eight" he addressed the latter sentence to Ron. Mr Weasley had always been fascinated with muggles and Hermione should have known that he would be this eccentric when they arrived."Alright dad, see ya" Ron replied, he and Harry both getting ready to enter the house."Bye Mr Weasley" Both Harry and Hermione said.With one finally wave and an envious look at the three children, Mr Weasley disappeared from sight and Ron and Harry finally stepped into the house
