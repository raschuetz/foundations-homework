Harry Potter and the MaraudersChapter 1AN: Please review, I could take all the ideas possible. I want to make a story for you readers to enjoy. This is my first story, and I want it to be good. I have read other authors fanfics, and am using ideas, but not stealing their story. This is the first chapter and I know its short but I have a lot to write after this and will get this story rolling. I have a poll on my profile, please vote and review. Reviews motivate me.James Potter and Lily Evans are walking near Black Lake, discussing what to do for there next date. They sat by a tree and watched the sunset as two figures appeared in front of there eyes...there was one man and one women both appearing to be around the age of 17. The flash of light blinded them long enough for the two to have wands up against their throats. "Mum! Dad!" the man yelled. Both teens lowering their wands and stepping back. James and Lily seemed confused as to why someone, the same age as the two of them was calling them his Mum and Dad. "Who are you two?" "I'm Hermione Granger." "Umm...I'm your son, Harry James Potter." "I have no idea what you are talking about, there is no way you could be our son." Lily announced. "What is the date?" Hermione wondered. "March 1st 1977."Hermione turned to Harry. "Harry do you know what we were doing before we appeared here?" "Well, we were about to be disintegrated by some death eaters. I concentrated on a safe place for us to apparate, then the next thing I knew I had my wand pointed to my father's throat." "Harry you must of accidentally caused us to travel through time."
