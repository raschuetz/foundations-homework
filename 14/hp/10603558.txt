A/N: Here's a preview of my first story. One good review and I'll continue. Constructive criticism is appreciated!'LILY!' I yelled, as I jumped over the fence into her back garden. She was standing next to a big oak tree chatting excitedly to Petunia. 'SAM!' she yelled back. 'I got my letter!' she held up a piece of parchment with "To Miss Lily Evans" written on the front in emerald green ink. I ran over to her and Petunia stepped to the side to avoid getting hit. 'Hey Tuney,' I said quickly to her and I turned to face Lily. 'So did I!' I said back. 'Sev's on his way here.' I opened up the letter and read it out loud.'Dear Miss LovegoodWe are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
