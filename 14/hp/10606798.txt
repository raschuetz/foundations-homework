The Good, The Bad and The Ugly Challenge.Ok, I haven't seen a story like this, so if there is then let me know. This came to me after watching the movie and realized that it would make a great Harry Potter story. And if you read my stories, then you know I suck at battle scenes.The ultimate showdown between 3 powerful wizards.This is my challenge to anyone that wants to take it up.The Characters:Harry Potter-The Good (Everyone's favorite Green eyed sex god and all around really nice guy, but still kicks serious butt to the bad guys)Albus Dumbledore-The Bad (Manipulative Old Bastard)Lord Voldemort-The Ugly(what? He has a snake face, of course he is the ugly)1. Harry is powerful. Not Godlike, but still stronger than Dumbles and Voldy. Magical animagus, but keep special magical talents to a minimum.It is ok to make him buff, but don't make him out to be some kind of superman/model.2. Harry is Not a pussy. He actually hunts down DE's for some extra cash and experience. Dead or Alive.3. Dumbledore is or is not evil. Either way he is bad to Harry.4. Snape is Dumbledore's spy. Draco is Harry's.5. I see Ron as being a paid spy for Dumbledore. Hermione is Not. Ginny is whatever you want.6. Marriage contracts for Harry. Multiple wives. try not to do normal ships. Someone like Daphne Greengrass, Tracy Davis, Susan Bones...etc.7. No final battle. Must be final Showdown between Harry, Dumbledore and Voldemort. Winner takes all!Let me know, if you want to do this, because I would love to read it.
