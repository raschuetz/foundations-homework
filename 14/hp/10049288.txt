Prologue REWRITTENA/N: This is a rewritten version of my official story 'Hidden in plain sight'- I didn't like where the plot was going so the reason of its rewriting.Seriously, the plot and content itself is confusing. If somebody started reading this fic and read later chapters he would have concluded the writer was on crack -_- And if there is one element I want my fiction to have, it is to be understandable to my readers. I'm grateful to all the followers of this story- and I apologize if you are disappointed. I truly am. I hope you will still follow, but if not oh well.WARNING: Short 100 word snippets each chapter because I express myself better in shorter chapters and I update faster (Didn't test out the last theory yet), fem!Harry, hints of child-abuse and feminism in later chapters.Disclaimer: I own nothing. Simple as that. This disclaimer is also for future chapters as well.I'm not sure where to begin I'm not sure if I should even begin And with what should I begin with? I'm not sure but, a man once told me:"You can only move on, once you have confronted your past."Whatever that means. Don't get me wrong or anything, but I firmly believe I have absolutely no qualms with my past.Or perhaps that's just me trying to comfort myself.Cause really, haven't we all looked back every once in a while?Or maybe that's still just me.I'm not too good at storytelling...But I'll do my best.
