AND SO WE FLED- October 12th 1900And so we fled. Away from the screaming, away from the accusations-sprinting off across the gardens, dodging curses as we went. Suzanna was crying, gasping for breath, begging me to Slow down! Just slow down Phineas, I can't breathe! But I knew we couldn't stop. Not yet. Not while we could still hear them. We had to get outside the manor's wall, once we were there, we could disparate. Suzanna hated apperating, but in our current predicament, she would have to get over it. I could hear their footsteps behind us and pulled her along faster. She stumbled, and a stunning spell flew over her head, missing her by inches. I was glad that at least they were not aiming to kill."Impedimenta!" I aimed the curse blindly over my shoulder, not caring if it hit one of them, in fact hoping that it wouldn't. I just needed them to slow down."Stop, Phineas!" I heard my brother shout, and I almost laughed, because, really, did Sirius expect me to stop now? Now, when I was so close to freedom? Now, when just moment before him and my brother had nearly killed Suzanna and me in my parent's kitchen?We rounded the corner and headed for the gate, ducking the hailstorm of jinx's my brother's were firing at us. The gate was still open, an oversight on Cygnus' part, one that I had counted on. He always forgot. No matter what mother said to him-I almost smiled at the thought."Phineas, please, wait!" It was Cygnus this time, his voice horse from lack of oxygen. I merely scoffed and pushed my legs harder, faster.And then we were free, bursting though the gate and out onto the cobblestone road. I swept Suzanna up into my arms before turning on the spot. The last glimpse I had of my former life was of my brother's faces-Sirius furious, Cygnus stricken, as Suzanna and I vanished into nothingness.
