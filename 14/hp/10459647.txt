"Hermione, you're amazing," Harry commented."Yeah, yeah, we know," Ron muttered from his position lying on the floor.Hermione glanced up from her book, The Interconnection of Charms and Transfiguration. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were studying, spread out in the Gryffindor common room."Thanks, Harry. You know, Ron, a compliment isn't bad once and a while. I know I'm amazing, what makes you think of it?" Hermione glanced at Harry's assigned Muggle Studies reading, something entitled Muggleborns - How?"Well it says here, and I'm quoting, 'Generally muggleborns are mediocre wizards. If not fairly bad at magic, they are almost never extraordinary. The only muggleborn to make the History books was Katila Puff, the inventor and genius.' And if I do say so myself, Hermione, you're better than Ron and me at spells, and we both have magical parents!"Instead of taking it as an interesting fact that proved her brilliance, Hermione thought about this discovery."Harry, may I borrow that book?"According to the book, written by Marigold Ivenhoe, no wizard or witch EVER came from entirely muggle lineage. Well, Hermione had scoured her lineage, down to the point where it wasn't even recorded anymore, and there were no wizards or witches.You probably think she missed one. But, being the ingenious witch that she was, she didn't miss things.But, being the ingenious witch that she was, she scoured again. No one magical.
