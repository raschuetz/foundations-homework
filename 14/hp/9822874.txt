Prologue(Part 1)Convicts IdeaOn a hot summer's night, Sirius Orion Black was sitting in an old damp kitchen. He sat thinking on the intelligence they had received from Kingsley about a possible recruit in the Department of Mysteries.The basement was full of chatter; there were about thirty people in there talking about what it could mean for them. They were all members of the same secret society, the Order of the Phoenix. The first meeting he had attended had been hard on him. He also knew that it had been hard on Remus too; both of them remembered the ghosts of friends long passed who had been there in similar meetings. James and Lily, bickering even during a meeting. The Prewitt Twins, ever the troublemakers and rowdy pair. Frank and Alice Longbottom, level headed and strong willed pair, and great friends. And then there was Marlene Mckinnon, with her long blonde, elegantly curly hair and her piercing blue-purple eyes, he could hear her laughing in his mind. Such a beautiful-Sirius turned his mind from his sombre thoughts; he knew that he would only get depressed.Sirius didn't give any input to this meeting, not that anyone would listen to him anyway. He sat thinking about what had happened; Voldemort's lack of activity, the Ministry pushing the Prophet to paint an image of Harry being a liar and unstable and Fudge's stance on the issue of Voldemort.He thought on it for the entire meeting and, when it broke up, he went up to his room and began to pace. However, he soon snapped out of it when Remus entered."What are you thinking about Padfoot?" Remus asked. "Your body may have been sitting in that meeting, but your mind was not there.""I do not like what is happening Moony," Sirius said, resuming his pacing. "Fudge is going to get us all killed and Harry is right in the middle of it!""Then I take it you have a plan?" Remus asked. "You remember the last time you acted without planning in advance?""Of course I do!" Sirius snapped. "I ended up in Azkaban for twelve years and then I was nearly kissed by a hundred Dementors!"Remus didn't say a word, but took a seat on Sirius' bed."Sorry," Sirius said. "I am just frustrated, I feel so useless and powerless. A powerless Black! What would my family think of me now?""You are not powerless Sirius," Remus said quietly. "You may not be as powerful politically as Lord Arcturus Black, but you are as powerful as he was magically.""My grandfather was a cold bastard, but he did make a formidable Lord Black -" Sirius started, but he suddenly had a thought. Lord Black. He was technically Lord Black; he was the last direct male descendent and with that came the power of the Noble and Most Ancient Families.Even though he had run away from the family, he still remembered the lessons he had been taught by his father and grandfather. The methods of a Black, the power of the Blacks and, more importantly, that Black's look after their own.He could claim it all if he wanted to, claim his rightful inheritance. Become Lord Black, Head of the Black Family. But there was something more he could do, he could make sure that Harry was ready for what was to come. Fudge was going after him, so he would need the lessons that he should have had from a young age.So for the next few minutes, with the help of Remus, he planned and made the arrangements that were needed. One person was central to their plan. A fifteen year old teenager, a boy who didn't know his own name or family history. Harrison James Potter.Lord Sirius Orion Black, Head of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black, was born in that moment of clarity. The Wizarding community would never again forget the power of the Black Family and they would remember to never harm someone under its protectionIt was time for his godson to learn who he was and his place in their world, but first he needed to get him to headquarters and for that he needed to plan, and patients.Prologue(Part 2)An inopportune startSirius was out in the overgrown garden behind headquarters. He was in the middle of grooming Buckbeak, he could still remember the day that he had acquired the beast.He had finally met his godson and Harry wanted to move in with him! Then Moony came out and then the Dementors. He had resigned himself to his fate, the Dementors kiss. He had failed his best friends again; he wouldn't be able to look after their son after finding him once more.He had no hope of escape, Auror's were outside the warded door and he was many floors up so the window was not an option. He knew that Dumbledore wouldn't be able to save him, Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump meant nothing, and he had a kiss on sight order on his head.Just as he was about to give up all hope, he had the shock of his life. There was a knock on the window, outside of which were Harry and his friend Hermione astride a hippogriff. His godson had come to rescue him and he had escaped from Hogwarts with the hippogriff.He smiled to himself as he brushed Buckbeak's rump with a brush, he should have known Harry would risk everything for someone he cared for. Harry had chased after his friend when Padfoot had dragged him into the Shack and, while he had not known Sirius for more than a few hours, he had still rescued him. James and Lily would have been so proud of him for that.Lily may have been more level headed than James, but if someone she cared for was in trouble then she would move heaven and earth to help them. He had seen her duel with such ferocity that he had been terrified of her. James was the same, while he was irrational when his emotions overcome him; he had been unstoppable the day his father died. It seemed that Harry had managed to take after his parents even when he had only been with them for just over a year."Sirius!" He heard Remus bellow.Running back into headquarters, he saw that people were arriving through the floo quickly. Panic worked its way in to his mind."Remus what's happened," he asked urgently. "Is it Harry?""Dementors attacked him! Dung just informed us; he had to defend himself while Dung bunked off to do business," Remus said.Thoughts were soaring through Sirius' mind at an alarming rate; this was why Harry had been given a guard! Fudge wanted an excuse to discredit him and he now had one. Luckily underage magic was only a disciplinary matter in Amelia Bones' office."Wait until I get my hands on that thief!" Sirius snarled, his hands gripping the kitchen table tightly imagining it was Dung's neck. "Is Harry ok?" He asked."Dung said he was fine. Arabella's cover is blown though, she was alerted by her kneazles," Remus said.They were interrupted by the chime of the floo and Arthur Weasley stepped out looking rather frantic."Arthur what is it?" Molly Weasley asked."Fudge!" He said between breathes, "He tried to expel Harry and was about to send an official to snap his wand, thankfully Dumbledore has arrived to sort it out. He is furious with Fudge. I got an owl off to Harry, telling him not to relinquish his wand."Sirius nodded, quickly pulled out his wand and summoned something some parchment and a self-inking quill. He then rushed out into the garden to write his note then he grabbed the owl that was sitting out there and tied the letter to its leg."Go, get that to Harry as quick as you can," he said to the owl. "It's an emergency," He threw the owl into the air; it took flight quickly and was off as fast as it could fly.He stormed back into the house and went up to the attic. He tried a summoning spell, but the item he needed did not come towards him. Frustrated he hissed, "Kreacher!""Master calls," the elf said with an exaggerated bow and he muttered under his breath.Sirius paid him no heed, he needed something now. "Where is the Black riding tack Kreacher?"The elf looked at him carefully, "Kreacher threw it out many years ago at Mistress' insistence, Master," he croaked, he then threw him a dirty look.Sirius cursed, "Then go to Ravens Wood House and get me a set now. I need it Kreacher, go!" The elf bowed and was gone with a pop.Sirius quickly descended the stairs and met Remus halfway down. "What are you doing Padfoot?" He asked."What we planned," Sirius replied. "Can you cover for me while I am gone?"Remus frowned, but nodded, "Tonks should be there when you arrive. Kingsley just told us that Dumbledore slipped her a message when he was at the Ministry. I will tell them that I have stunned you in your bedroom and locked you in there to make sure you didn't do anything. How will you get there?""Thank you," Sirius said "I will  "He couldn't finish his sentence as he was interrupted by Kreacher. In his arms was set of black tack. "As requested, Master," he said and he dumped it on the floor before disappearing with a crack."You cannot fly a hippogriff!" Remus exclaimed, "It is still light out, Sirius!"They walked into the garden and bowed to the hippogriff. "I will place disillusionment charms on us both; it will be fine! Besides, it's getting dark now."Remus nodded begrudgingly, "I better go, be careful Sirius, remember our entire plan resides on Harry getting here and he doesn't need to get in any further trouble."Sirius nodded and pulled out his wand, he pointed it at the tack and then at Buckbeak, the tack soon secured itself to the hippogriff. Sirius quickly got into the saddle with practiced ease.Holding the reins in his hands, he gave Buckbeak a nudge with his legs. Buckbeak began to move towards one end of the garden and shifted in anticipation, Sirius cast the disillusionment charm on them both."Right then Buckbeak, get me to my godson," he said and, without the need for further command, Buckbeak propelled up with his back legs. With two powerful sweeps of his wings, he was in the air. Sirius looked out in the direction of Surrey; he just hoped that Harry had received his message.**********Author's Note***********BETA*D***** NOOKA****This story was originally posted as "Harry Potter and the New Order of the Phoenix"I am re writing my entire story. Please review!***********Acknowledgements****************All credit goes to J k Rowling for the Harry Potter World that I have borrowed for this story. I have wrote this story for fun after reading Fanfiction for 6 years, and over that time I have found parts that I have liked, but I have felt could all be put together into one storyI have also been inspired not only by many Fanfiction writers, but also from published authors, also films and Television programmes.Downton Abbey, Upstairs Downstairs, Young Victoria, The Duchess and Titanic gave me the aristocracy, the ways of life and political manoeuvring, the power of wealth and influence and much moreGame of Thrones - these books gave me the idea of the great Houses, whilst already in the HP universe, I have expanded this. they are lords of land, and in HP this was once true in the Ancient Family history.Avatar Last air bender (animated series) and the Legend of the seeker, and Merlin these all gave me the ideas for the Blood RageTV series Merlin inspired me to use it as part of the HP histories. i have adapted it to fit my story.I have ready many stories that use The Ancient and Noble House statusnobility statusFamily magicfamily ringsBlood adoptionsSirius/HarryThese are my favourite plots in Fanfiction, so of course I will use them!
