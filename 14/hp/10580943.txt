CHAPTER ONETHE BASTARD WHO LIVEDIt was midnight. An old ass man appeared. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.Albus Dumbledore whipped out a lighter and held it up to a street lamp. He lit a joint and as he inhaled, pondered as to why it was so fucking bright. Dumbledore imagined how far the fucking cops would be up his ass if they saw him here smoking this fine herb. He would probably have to kill them.Dumbledore sat down next to a cat while slipping the lighter back into his cloak, but he fumbled it and burnt the crap out of his hand."Fuck me up the asshole.""This is some good shit," said Dumbledore. "Would you care for a hit?"The cat stared at him, and Dumbledore blew smoke into its face. The cat used its paw to wave the fumes away."Bone me up the butthole again!"Dumbledore jumped up and tried to kick the cat, but it was a woman now."Where in the fuck is fucking Hagrid?" asked Professor McGonagall, ignoring the attempted assault."The dumbass ogre's late as usual.""I would trust Hagrid to fuck this up," said Dumbledore.They heard a loud rumbling and then shouting."Fuck outa me way yeh faggots!" said a big ass hairy ass ugly ass troll on a motorcycle. He swerved between the two and mounted the curb. "Special delivery fer the trash at number four, Privet Drive!"Hagrid chucked a baby wrapped in blankets at the doorstep. The baby suffered a wound to his forehead in the shape of a bolt of lightning. They all bailed and hauled ass.
