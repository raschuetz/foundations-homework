HelloI know we aren't supposed to use these platforms to publish but im looking for a Harry Potter fic.In the fic Harry is sent to an alternate world after he dies so that he can live a happy life. He ends up being looked after by this old couple (I think they named him Jamie?) after Dumbledore convinced the Potters that he wasn't the chosen one and that his sibling (a girl I think) was. He ends up being engaged to Hades and Draco, Ginny, Hermione, Ron etc join him eventually.I would really appreciate your help with finding the fic! Thanks a bunch! xxx
