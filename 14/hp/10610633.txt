Entry for the "Art Club" at "Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry"Category: ArtI hope you enjoy this one, my first try on the Neville/Luna pairing! :)Neville closed his eyes, inhaling the wonderful scent of the summer evening that was full with flowers and growing wheat from the fields all around. He was sitting at a small river near Ottery St. Catchpole, waiting for the girl that had captured his heart. The summer air was soft and warm as the sun started to set and all he could feel was freedom and happiness  the war was over and everyone started to feel safe again.He turned as he heard the soft ruffling of the wheat behind pushed to the side as someone walked through it and he stood up as she approached him, her white dress flowing over her body and her blonde hair shining golden in the sun.Neville smiled down at Luna as she reached him and their fingers entwined in between their bodies."I missed you", she said in her dreamy voice, smiling back at him and Neville felt his heart open up again."I know", he answered and leaned forward to kiss her on the lips. The moment was feeling simply perfect and all he wanted was for it to last forever as they were standing here, the last rays of the sun making the water of the river sparkle as it was shining down at the scenery and the couple that was kissing, drifting away on the carefree experience of a summer love.
