It would be the tiny bit of sun shining through the gray, depressing blanket of clouds.But it was a war.As the days passed, there was increasingly fewer things to smile about.Maybe someday, after the war, Marlene's smile would come as easy as it once had.Too bad she never lived to see the end of it.~oOo~AN: So there it is how'd you like it?
