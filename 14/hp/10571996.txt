A/N: Ok, if the title and summary wasn't clear enough, this is basically Wicked for Bellatrix Lestange. Now, I'm going to be taking some liberties with characters and timelines and ages and such to make it work better for the story. If you don't like people messing with canon, don't read this.Disclaimer: I don't own Harry Potter or Wicked. Never have, never will.Andromeda Tonks P.O.V.:No One Mourns the StrangeShe's dead. My sister is dead. The Wizarding World celebrates and I long to be among them. She murdered my daughter, her regime killed my husband, and now my grandson is an orphan, all because of her.Yet I can't.I can't hate her, my darling sister Bella, who never fit in at Hogwarts, who always defended Cissy from bullies, who promised to be my sister no matter what our family put us through. See, mother and father weren't faithful to each other, to the point where they didn't know whose daughter was who's. But family troubles never stopped her from being strange, especially in the hallowed halls of Hogwarts.
