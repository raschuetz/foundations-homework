And I fall back; arms open wide, not as whom I wished to be- but instead that at which I began- cold and alone and perfectly mortally human. A conqueror, mighty in the blood of the fallen and immortal in his cause, falling back, not only in death, but in time to the start of the journey- back to the parallels shared between my undoer and I and the choices that separated our fates into the paths that led us back here, together again, until death do us part.Let them rejoice in their victory. Let them cheer and promise better futures. But watch them fall back- fall back into the same habits and patterns that bred the monster they have just slain and watch another, and another, and another rise to take it's place. Let them fall back and watch their hero unable to- frozen in time: unable to fall back with the others and unable to progress and grow in a society so stagnant. Watch him be sued ad abused by the same society that breeds his next opponents, slowly murdering him as he watches the record spin again and again and again until, he too, joins me in death.And I, then, am victorious.
