Obliviate- Chapter 1.Hermione and Ron stepped of the Hogwarts express for their 6th year at Hogwarts. The train ride was dull but it didn't snuff out the happiness bubbling up inside her. She was back. Back at Hogwarts with her best friends. Ron was walking next to her at a steady pace, their strides almost in sync. Harry though, was still back on the train. He had told them to go on ahead while he "checked something out". Hermione couldn't help be just a little worried about him but she knew he would be fine. Ron's arm brushed against Hermione's sending unexpected, warm shivers up her spine.'What do you think Harry's doing?' said Ron trying to make conversation.She thought about it but couldn't come up with a single thing. 'I don't know, I just hope he isn't late for the Sorting Ceremony.'}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}The feast was just about to begin and Harry still wasn't here. The Hall was filled with familiar faces as Hermione glanced around nervously. She caught someone staring at her in the corner of her eye, turning around she saw it was Draco Malfoy. Malfoy had none of his usual demeanour, he looked different. Blood shot eyes with faint dark circles underneath them. He dropped his gaze to the table as the ceremony began. Hermione couldn't concentrate throughout the whole sorting ceremony, her thoughts kept wondering to Harry and if he was okay. She had a sure feeling that Malfoy would know something about it and made a mental note to confront him after the Sorting was over. She thought about what could be wrong with Draco to put him in such an unusual state when she reminded herself she couldn't care less. He was still Malfoy.After the Sorting Ceremony was finally over she stood up and got out of her seat to walk to the Slytherin table. Ron shot her a confused look as she shuffled past him. Students were starting to clear the room and by the time she got to their table there was only a few people here and there. Malfoy sat slumped against the table with his head resting down on his arms, fatigue plaguing his features.'Malfoy.' Hermione said loudly. He lifted up his head and turned around disappointed to find her there.He sighed, 'Sod off, Granger.' He hissed, 'I've got better things to be doing than wasting my time talking to you.''Don't flatter yourself, Malfoy.' Hermione muttered coldly, He turned his head looking somewhere else. 'I just want to know if you have seen-'Potter?' he spat, looking back at her. Hermione nodded. Draco cocked his head towards the doors at the entry of the Hall. She turned to see Harry striding in holding a tissue soaked in blood up to his nose. She bolted up to him and lead him to a seat asking him what happened and why he was so late. Ron saw him and ran over to them as well. Once they were both there Harry told them about his idea on the train to see what Malfoy was up to using his invisibility cloak. Draco caught him and not taken it well. Luckily Luna had found Harry and helped him back.'But, Hermione..' he told her, 'I did hear your name mentioned before well, this happened.' He gestured awkwardly to his face. She wondered what they were saying about her behind her back as they walked back to the Gryffindor tower.Once they were back in the common room they collapsed on the couches near the warm, crackling fire.'Are you alright Hermione?' Ron asked.She was caught by surprise at his question and wondered if she didn't look okay or he was just trying to be friendly. Was she alright? She did feel a little sick. Maybe the feast food was playing with her stomach.'Oh. Yeah- I'm fine.' Hermione muttered, 'I just- I think I need some air. She got up from the chair and headed out of the common room towards peace and quiet. Hermione still had some time before curfew so she wandered the halls of the school. Hogwarts was so different at night.. Eerie almost.She kept walking until she tripped on a cushioned fabric. Catching herself on a pillar before she could actually hurt herself. Hermione looked around to see what it was she tripped over to find darks robes with green and silver on them. Of course. Just her luck. The robes belonged to Malfoy.{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{'Watch it.' Draco snapped looking up to see who would be walking around at this time of the night. He couldn't see very well in the dark butt he squinted to see the red and gold markings of the robes. Excellent. A Gryffindor. Just what he needed. He could hear some muttering of obscenities from what sounded like a feminine voice.'Speak for yourself, Malfoy.' Ah, yes he knew that voice and he definitely did not welcome it.'Interrupt your little late-night stroll did I Granger?' Draco's voice sounded a little choked.. If Hermione looked a little closer she could make out that there were just drying tear-stains on his face.'Yes, you did.' She said bluntly. 'What are even doing out by yourself this late Malfoy. It's almost curfew.''I couldn't care less about the sodding curfew,' Draco spat defensively. 'I could say the same for you, walking around by yourself. You managed to detach yourself from the sidekick and the hero did you?''I'm just surprised you haven't got Blaise and Goyle following you around like puppies, get bored of you did they?' she retorted quickly. Hermione saw his shoulders slump slightly. There was definitely something wrong.'What do you want, Granger. Is there a reason you're still here?' Draco said sharply.Hermione turned around to leave before stopping and without thinking she walked back towards him.'Are- Are you um, Are you okay?' she stuttered feeling like an absolute idiot. Draco looked up slowly with a puzzles look drawn across his face before he could compose himself.'Peachy.' The word was tied off with a ribbon of sarcasm. There was an air of silence before she could think to respond. Hermione was just about to leave for good this time when Draco spoke.'What does It matter to you Granger?' he said suspiciously. 'You hate me. Why would you care?'.Why did she care? She asked herself.. No. She definitely didn't care she was just Curious. Yep, Curious. 'I don't- Care that is.' She said quickly with a forced air of nonchalance. Hermione realised it was probably way past curfew by now and turned on her heel and walked as quickly as possible back to the common room knowing Malfoys glare was on her back as she did.Once she got back into her dorm in her bed Hermione decided she had left feeling better than she had come back feeling. Her stomach felt as if it had been stuffed with something sticky and slow moving like honey. What was that?! "Are you Okay?" How could she be so stupid. He obviously didn't like her before and now what would he think of her. 'How could I be such a moron!' she groaned into her pillow.
