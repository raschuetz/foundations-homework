"MOM!""What dear?""Hugo stole my quill, my favorite quill!""Hugo give your sister back her quill so we can leave for the station."It was the day for Hugo and I to go back to Hogwarts. I was entering my seventh year and Hugo was in his Fifth year. My two best friends Al and Scorpius were also in their final year too. Louis, Fred, Lily, Molly and Lucy were still in Hogwarts with us.We all shoved into the enchanted car and dad took off. All of us were hanging onto the sides of the car so we wouldn't fall down and hurt ourselves."Ron please slow down!""There's no need for that, we'll be late if i slow down.""Are you sure you got your license and you didn't obliviate the instructor?" asked mom"No, no that never happened" He answered, "At least I wasn't the only one who did it." he murmured under his breath.When we got to the station we all filed out of the car and ran through the barrier to the train. I immediately sought the mop of black and blonde hair. I found them and ran toward them, screaming their names. Scorp turned around and nearly fell over from the red head colliding with him."Hey scorp how was your summer?""It was great, how about you?""Okay, I love Hugo but he was driving me crazy.""We all know that feeling." he replied dryly"I know, you have it worse with three brothers.""Yes i do and they are terrible.""Hey guys the trains about to depart." Al interrupted us just as the whistle blew telling us to get on the train. I hugged my parents goodbye and got on the train. I mulled over something my father had said. He told me to be extra careful this year, for he felt something bad was going to happen. I quickly shook the thoughts from my head and sat down to catch up with my best friends.Hi people, so I've written a few other stories but i deleted them because i didn't like the plot line so i started another.
