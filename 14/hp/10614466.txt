Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter.AN: So I am currently working on a gay flamboyant Harry Potter story and this super short one shot just sprung up in my head so I thought I'd write it."No Harry!," Hermione snapped at the pouting boy -who-lived."But Hermione if you let me loose on your hair for a few minutes I can turn it from a wild beast to into a purring kitten, " Harry begged, he'd wanted to style Hermione's hair ever since they'd become friends.Hermione shot Harry a glare that would make others tremble, but Harry knew Hermione too well for it work on him. "My hair is not a wild beast.""Sweetie, I love you and think you're gorgeous, but honey your hair at times has a life of its own and very angry life at that," Harry said, checking his nails to make sure the pink nail polish hadn't chipped away."Harry, if don't stop bugging me to do my hair, I swear! I will tell Draco Malfoy you have a crush on him." Hermione threatened.Harry blushed slightly, Hermione was the only person who knew he fancied Draco. Everybody knew he was gay and had known for a long while, but his crush on Draco was not something he wished to advertise. "Fine, I'll stop bugging you. But you know if you ever told anybody about Draco I'd tell everybody about that dream you had about a certain someone." Harry looked smug as Hermione's cheeks and neck turned bright red.
