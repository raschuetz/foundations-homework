Hi guys.i just wanted to let you all know that I have adopted this story from hp princess no. 1. She is an amazingly talented writer that I have had the pleasure of beta-ing and cowriting with. Feel free to read the original and help me encourage her to write more.She may also be uploading the continued chapters onto her profile. So she is not copying me or anything, she is just allowing the readers to continue to read the story without having to look for it.On further notice, I am looking for a beta for this story. So if you are interested private message me.Thank you,DNStalker
