A/N: Welcome to my first Next Generation fic, iI would like to say that ideas are welcomed and if you review with an OC I will put it in the story, unless it is a child of Harry, Ron or Draco. I will not put ideas in this story that kill off any of the main characters, if you make an OC that you want me to kill off I will do so. Any questions or comments just Review or PM me:) DISCLAIMER: I do not own this theme song, nor do I own Harry Potter:)Chapter One: Theme song, Harry Potter and The Rising of the Moon"O come tell me Tom O'Feral, tell me why you hurry so."He coughed a hairball, hissed, fur glistened, and his whiskers wiggled low.I bear rumor from Godric's Hollow that You-Know-Who is throughHe killed James and Lily Potter, by the rising of the moon.By the rising of the moon, by the rising of the moon.He killed James and Lily Potter, by the rising of the moon.Then come tell me Tom O'Feral, where the gathering is to beOld Hagrid says on Privet Drive, muggles live there says he.But McGonagall and Dumbledore should meet Hagrid there soonOn the doorstep of the Dursley's by the rising of the moon.By the rising of the moon, by the rising of the moon.On the doorstep of the Dursley's by the rising of the moon.Out from drain pipes, roofs and windows, golden eyes peered through the nightNay a paw was heard to shuffle, neath that amber street lamp lightRumors ran along the alleys, like the barn owls lowly croonAnd a hundred cats were gathered by the rising of the moon.By the rising of the moon, by the rising of the moon.And a hundred cats were gathered by the rising of the moon.On the corner of 4 Privet Drive, a tabby cat did stand,Then the lamp lights disappeared inside old Dumbledores right hand.A baby slept in Hagrid's arm when his motorcycle touched doonWhat will become of Harry Potter by the rising of the moon.By the rising of the moon, by the rising of the moon.What will become of Harry Potter by the rising of the moon.By the rising of the moon, by the rising of the moon.And hurrah, at last, for freedom, by the rising of the moon.
