Lucius said, stomping in his sparkly white wedges. "Why are you trying to steal my spotlight? This is kind of my moment, blonde traitor!"Arthur frowned. "What?" He asked. "Did you say blood traitor or blonde traitor?"Gilderoy gave a cry of rage. "This ignorant troll! Let's swagger away and go for seaweed facials!" He grabbed Malfoy by the wrist and led him off.
