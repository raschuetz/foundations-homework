Disclaimers: Don't ownAN:It starts off awfully depressing, but it'll be more interesting once the trio go back in time. And pls follow! I promise to update every day or so! Pretty please... I beg you!Chapter one: Lost loves-POV:HermioneHermione had been in this room for two months, five days, seven hours and fifty five minutes to be exact. Voldemort had been defeated at a great price- a price that Hermione couldn't afford. Ron, her fianc had died alongside her best friend, Harry. She had no one in the world. Her parents had been killed, they were sought for and killed by the handful of remaining death eaters that were hungry for revenge. The only reason she was still alive was because Luna, who wasn't so close to her before the second war, had taken care of her, forcing her to eat and drink. She had no reason to live.
