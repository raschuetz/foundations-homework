ANSo I had this idea and liked it! I hope you all enjoy!Prologue-Peter had slipped up. He had told Sirius about how he was telling Voldemort where the Potters were hiding. As soon as it had left his lips Sirius had left to tell his friends."James! Lily!" He yelled running into there house. "What is it?" Lily said running down the stairs holding Harry, James was on her heals. "Voldemort he's coming here tonight! He's going to try to kill you! And Harry too! It's all Peters fault he's been giving information to Voldemort!" "We have to get Dumbledore, and the order," James said, "I'll go get them you three stay here!" And with that he left and Sirius explained a bit more to Lily.The door was blown off its hinges. Four order members were waiting at the top of the stairs, he killed them easily. They were the only members besides the Potters in the house. He made his way farther into the house and into Harry's room. James held his wand out protectively and pushed Lily behind him when Voldemort entered. She began to cry. "Please don't hurt Harry! Kill me instead! Just don't hurt him please I beg you!" She called out. He only smiled a wicked grin. "Avada Kedavra!" She dogged it instinctively, but Harry had moved at the same time. The curse hit him, but it didn't kill him. It only left a scar in the shape of a lightning bolt. James quickly disarmed the Dark Lord and put him in a full body bind. Lily picked up Harry and tried to comfort him while James wrote to Dumbledore.Dumbledore and the minister showed up around ten minutes later. They sent Voldemort to Azkaban where the dementors would performed the kiss in a few hours.The war was over now. No more people would be killed and the Potters survived. You could call it a twist of fate.
