Harry Potter and the Giants of the Black SeaIt was the night before the Finals of the "Quidditch world cup", Harry Potter and his Wife Ginny were sitting just at the window of the VIP tent, just looking at the stars outside, and hugging looking at their kids lying in bed sleeping peacefully.Harry just smiled after he looks at the stars, kiss his wife smoothly and just got up and carry her to bed, as the door slightly shut behind them, and the candles just turned off magically we can see from the window that life is good, it seem our friend finally is living his dream.But not all things that seem to be perfect are perfect, and from a distance, right beyond the fireworks from the Weasleys shop that is lighting the world Cup skies above, dragons and rockets, deep in the edges of the dark forest in Hogwarts something is trying to awake, and some things that should not have been forgotten are becoming legends.Back in the shadows, from the fallen leaves of the trees at night, voices still heard, screams, glances of the past still lives in these shadows, a boot from the calm lake next to Hogwarts is stepping out, walking on the dry rocks, pieces of weed from the lake drop off as he walk, face cannot be seen as darkness cover the identity of the mysterious man.As that man walk, trees move from his way, branches dry off, draw out scared, spiders run from his way as he reach that same spot of that mysterious day, right where the memories draw us to the same place where who must not be named struck an avada kedavra on the Young Harry potter only to kill a part of him.As darkness is drawn out from the ground where harry were lying, and enter that man body, the man fades again into the lake mysteriously, no words, no trace except some dead branches on the ground.The night passed , morning came, birds are singing at the window of harry oldest son Albus waking him as he slowly open his eyes and got up putting his glasses , it seem his low vision are passed along from his father .Running out of his room, his mother cooking some waffles and dad reading the daily prophet in the kitchen, Albus morning his father and mother as he run outside is his pajamas and slippers not caring about eating from that delicious waffles of his mother.Harry as he look at his wife told her" don't look at me, he must got that from you, I love your waffles "and eat one.Outside life is pretty , colorful grass of spring time , kids and people everywhere preparing for the big night , Albus just trying to chase some birds playing outside , running  and almost hit a strange man , grey robe , tall , white beard and a fairly pointy hat , as we don't see his face , we can hear the old man telling young Albus to be careful as he walk , Albus as he look a bit scared the old man offer him a chocolate frog , as he walk away and disappear in the crowds , we can hear Ginny Weasley calling her son back , as he look puzzled and run back home.As Albus enter the tent Ginny saw the chocolate in his hands and look mad a bit, Albus you won't eat that frog before breakfast put that away right this instant and eat your plate.And as a good son, Albus look sad, put the package down on the table and started to eat his plate as his sister and brother came to the table and saw the package of chocolate and were excited but face their mother looking at them and sit tight on the table as harry look back at Ginny and back at his kids assuring them that after breakfast they will all go and get some.Time passed the frog forgotten on the table from excitement ,suddenly the package had a bump on its own , humping on the table , falling on the floor, as no one notice , it get into Albus room , and into his jacket that was hanging on the back of the half open door there.Harry taking his family to the market as promised , Ginny carrying her daughter and harry holding his sons hands, walking, smiling, talking, we could see some tents selling magical stuff and a paper on the ground is blown with piece of the daily prophet on it show " Muggle farmer found dead wrapped in branches in suburbs London" .They have arrived to the shop , the Weasleys shop , everyone can imagine the chaos in that tent , flying small planes, love potions, jokes and from all the faces , Ron is at the shop helping his brothers , of course his family is helping , Hermione , now a stunning woman is helping in the books section , seeing harry they both go to see him and greet him , as the attention is not with them anymore with Albus sneaking out of his father's hand and wandering in the shop seem to stand In front of the Chocolate frog stand , as we can see the kids all trying to get one , Albus just waiting his turn , he bumped again to what it seem the same man from the market earlier , this time the man voice seem strangely familiar to us asking Albus what is he doing there, and Albus saying " Getting my chocolate frog", and the strange man replying , oh well , it seem they are all out today .Young Albus looking back to the stand , and sadly puzzled to see the stand is empty now , the man approach him , without seeing his face but reaching with his hand, that have a familiar scar on it , and holding Albus chin up and saying , well maybe another time young one , don't forget to check your pockets .As Albus say nothing in there I won't get any, and he put his hands in his pocket and was surprised to find the chocolate frog in his pocket. Albus took it out and looked again to the old man to find out he disappeared.Albus took refuge under the stairs there , it seem his father passion for the quiet hiding place of his father is reaching up with him fast, next to a box , Albus open the card box, only to find out it is empty, nothing inside.Albus is now sad closes the card again , and put it on the floor , and put his hands on his cheeks in despair , no chocolate or card for him today , and then bump, the card jump , as he looked afraid he try to touch it , but it jumped again , so he hold it with both his hands, and open it , something strange somewhat happen as from it a frog came out , as Albus delighted as he catch it and put it in his mouth in content , the card bumped again.As he looked the card is glowing a bit , for he forgot to take his card , he turn the package and took out the card , it was an Dumbledore Card , sadly he was not in the window , empty card ; he put it in his pocket and away to his parents.
