Just a little thing that I wrote for Quiz*lla, but it turned out that Quiz*lla wouldn't let me publish it, for unknown reasons... (sigh)And, just a side note, I am a heterosexual cisgender female, so I apologize if it may shine through at times, I don't mean to make it exclusive to girls or anything. I'd like everyone to enjoy the intimacy of the Hogwarts boys! Also, I'd like to just mention that I try to keep the characters as in-character as possible, but if there are flaws, I apologize now!OKAY! Enough of the disclaimers and apologies. Onto the story!Alright, the party is supposed to take place in the Room of Requirement toward the end of the year. Not sure which year, if there was an imaginary year between the fourth and fifth, it would be then. You can pick a number which will correspond with the following chapters' titles. So, READ THE TITLES OF THE CHAPTERS!You were just eating with your friends when someone comes up behind you and hands you a piece of paper, they whisper, "Tonight, end of the year party." When you turned around, you didn't see who it was, but read the paper. It had instructions to pace three times by a wall and think about needing to be at "the coolest party ever". You follow the instructions around the time instructed on the invitation while nobody was around and a door presented itself. You enter and there were so many people! You talk and drink butterbeer and soon there was a ruckus. Harry Potter had made an announcement that you hadn't heard. You join everyone else and Harry was looking around. He locked eyes with you and shoved a hat filled with paper in your hand.You picked either:-"One?"-"Two."-"This is either a three or a capital E.."-"Four?"-"Five!"-"This is either a six or a nine.."-"Seven."-"This is an eight, but it looks like a snowman."
