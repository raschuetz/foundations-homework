A hand closed around her arm and she was suddenly pulled to her feet."Are you alright?" a soft voice asked.She found herself looking up at a complete stranger with wide eyes."Who are you?" she asked bluntly.He smiled kindly."Remus Lupin.

I found a list of prompts online and decided to give it a go~ I'll be updating regularly with more drabbles so stay tuned ;)
