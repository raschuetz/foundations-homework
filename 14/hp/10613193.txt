No matter how hard I try, I can't keep ideas out of my head and, since we're approaching the end of summer, it's like my mind's on overdrive, so expect a couple of new ideas to rear their heads and, if I say I'm going with them, then that's what I'll do.Anyway, this one is an idea that I've wanted to work with and, admittedly, a pairing idea that I've wanted to have a go at for some time, so let's see what happens. And, of course, as always, if you don't like it, then don't read it.Challenge Information: DZ2's 'I Choose You' Challenge: Harry doesn't choose the prophecy or Dumbledore or the Order or the Light: instead, he follows his true destiny and chooses Voldemort.Rules: Dark or Evil Harry  DarkWhen Harry chooses to join Tom/Voldemort, it must be completely willingWhatever the reason for Harry's defection, Tom/Voldemort treats Harry as his second in command/heirHarry must get a second wand and either stash/destroy the holly-and-phoenix feather wandThe defection must happen either in Harry and Tom going after the Stone, in the Chamber, when Wormtail escapes, at Tom's resurrection, the Ministry Battle or any time in the summer after these events  After the resurrectionHarry must become the leader of the Junior Death EatersIf he defects before Sirius' death  unless Sirius lives in your story  then Bellatrix becomes a maternal figure for HarryIf Harry defects and Sirius is still alive, he MUST follow his godson and turn DarkOne of the Inner Circle  Snape, Lucius, Bellatrix, Crouch etc.  must become Harry's mentor in the Dark ArtsGuidelines: Tom learns that Harry is a Horcrux  AcceptedHarry learns that he is a Horcrux  AcceptedWhen Harry defects, he originally asks Tom to kill him  AcceptedAll pairings are welcome except HaremsSlash  AcceptedSlavesHarry turning full-dark and ostracizing Ron and Hermione  AcceptedIn Tom's resurrection, he comes back human and not as half-snake facial appearance  AcceptedTom teaches Harry to absorb the Horcrux and become more powerful  AcceptedForbidden: Grey or Light HarryDumbledore managing to change Harry's mindIf before the Ministry Battle, then Sirius cannot dieOther than that, it's up to you...Dedication: I'd like to dedicate to every one of those patient and understanding readers who enjoy my ideas no matter how old or new they may be; my recommended reads are Suns of Death and Darkness by Chakahlah and Rise of the Dark Lords by AdriannaAJ; two amazing stories amongst the hundreds I have added to my favouritesKey Pairing: Harry/DracoOther Pairings: Neville/Luna; Others TBCNormal Speech'Thought'/Parseltongue/Chapter 1: The Midnight HorrorTom Marvolo Riddle, otherwise known as the Dark Lord Voldemort, was in the middle of a dilemma;Ever since his return nearly a fortnight ago now, things had been fairly quiet for the Dark Lord in his gathering of his loyal followers, ensuring the punishments of those who'd defected and abandoned him and making sure, all the while, that his power was just as great as it had been since before the day of his vanquishing.And yet, throughout each and every one of these missions and tasks, the Dark Lord felt the dilemma creeping up on him, partially because of what it concerned, but more because of whom his dilemma was concerning.Harry James Potter: Gryffindor's Golden Boy, Dumbledore's little warrior-wizard and the biggest pain in the neck that Tom would ever meet.When last they'd met, Tom had seen a side of Harry that perfectly matched the Gryffindor element in him: strong-willed, a foolish amount of bravery, reckless to the end and willing to do almost anything to achieve victory for the Light. The burning of Quirrell's face and the forced exorcism of Tom's soul from the man's body was a big twist for the Dark Lord, but a bigger twist was the power that Tom had felt in that destructive magic.All right, the magic had all but drained Harry's reserves to the point that even the phasing-through of Voldemort's spirit had knocked him down and sent him spiralling into unconsciousness, but the fact remained that Harry had summoned some serious levels of power.After that, Tom had been careful about how close he got to the young boy until the time was right, but, at the same time, in the midst of his recuperation, the Dark Lord had felt a sense of pain burst through his soul. Following the pain to its source, Tom was surprised to find his younger, slightly-more handsome self being destroyed by Harry and a Basilisk fang.He'd been forced to admit it then: the boy had some serious mind power behind him to work with one of the world's deadliest magical items.Then, in the Triwizard Tournament, the Dark Lord had seen it: when he'd risen from that cauldron, it hadn't been as a snake-faced monster as he'd first believed: instead, it was as his younger, handsome self and, when he'd looked to Harry before seeing to the Death Eaters, Tom could almost swear that there had been a smile on Harry's face. Then the smile had faded and the boy seemed to struggle against his bonds, but, all the while, Tom couldn't get the smile out of his head.If he didn't know better, he would have believed that Harry had wanted Tom to come back and to take his blood to do it, but that was impossible.The boy was as Gryffindor as one could get, so why and how would he actually want the Dark Lord to come back?In the fortnight since that day, Tom had gone about his business as only the Dark Lord could: he'd gathered his forces together again, which involved a little trip to Azkaban Prison to pick up his most-faithful  Bellatrix, Rabastan, Rodolphus and Dolohov to name but a few of them  where, to the Dark Lord's surprise, the Ministry's lack of faith in his return had left Azkaban unguarded by anything except Dementors.Returning to the manor had brought Tom full circle, his current seat in front of the fireplace with Nagini curled up next to him being the same place that he'd been sat for the past few hours. Staring into the flames, Tom could see it again now: that confident, almost-gracious smile and those intense green eyes."Why, Harry?" whispered the Dark Lord, his voice calm as he stared into the flames, "Why do you smile?"The flames just danced in the hearth as though mocking him in response, leaving Tom to laugh before he conjured a drink and, resting in front of the fireplace, the Dark Lord let his mind wander to the next task at hand.Unmasking the SnakeIt was close to midnight when Tom was woken by the sense of his home's wards being breached, his eyes narrowing as he felt a foreign, but somehow familiar presence on the grounds. Rising from his chair, Tom moved out of the living room and through to the main hall, the darkness of his manor estate making him feel comfortable and as much at home as anyone else would feel. This was his place: no-one dared enter without his permission and, if anyone did, then it was only a matter of fact that they were from the Light.And yet, from what he could sense, Tom could sense something that was neither good or evil, but magic: a familiar, eerie magic that seemed to waver and pulse weakly, almost like a combination of a drunk person and someone or something with few minutes left to live.As the presence stopped at the door to his home, Tom reached out, his wand held in his other hand as, with a gentle, wary motion, he opened the door.What he saw on the other side would haunt him forever: Harry James Potter, the source of his thoughts from last time, his clothes ripped and torn, blood dripping from his fingers and what could only be described as a painful, deadly-looking gash across his chin and neck; his eyes were bloodshot, but there was enough brightness to recognise Tom standing in front of him."YouwinTom" Harry gasped out, before his body finally succumbed to his injuries and, before Tom had a chance to move, the young wizard fell to the floor, unable to keep himself on his feet any longer.In any other lifetime, Tom might have let Nagini eat the body lying in front of him, but now, instead of summoning his familiar, the Dark Lord almost ripped his own sleeve off his arm and, triggering the Dark Mark, he summoned assistance.All the while, his eyes on the boy as he whispered, "Hold on, Harry: please hold on."Unmasking the SnakeIn his lifetime, Lucius Malfoy had encountered a wide range of emotions from friends and enemies alike: from fear and expectation to pride and desire.However, if there was one man and one emotion that he had never thought he would ever see in the same scenario, it would be the Dark Lord feeling fear: he was the Dark Lord for a reason, after all. He feared nothing and destroyed all in his path: he was a man with power and glory and no sense of worry, concern or sorrow.Yet, when Lucius was woken from his sleep by a burning Dark Mark that felt more like someone was trying to barbecue his arm right off his shoulder, it was fear that Lucius appeared in front of and fear that he saw in the eyes of the Dark Lord. However, as he went to bow to his Lord as was his duty on any summoning, Lucius' eyes widened with horror when he saw the battered, broken and bloody body lying in the Dark Lord's robed embrace.There was no mistaking that scar and that wild hairstyle: Harry Potter, almost barely breathing, was lying in the arms of his Lord and, as Lucius looked, he was aware of the infamous red eyes of the Dark Lord showing through his humane dark-brown eyes as he hissed, "Help him, Lucius: now!"Lucius would have argued that this was Harry Potter, but there was no room for argument when the Dark Lord went from Tom to Voldemort with those red eyes of his. Taking Harry from the man's arms, Lucius bowed low before he explained, "I will have to return to my manor, my Lord: I can assist young Mr Potter there more than I could here.""Then I am coming with you," hissed Tom, rising and, with a few swishes of his wand, he changed his robes and Harry's torn clothes into something more comfortable, though not cleaner as the blood of the young wizard still flowed from whatever wounds he'd been inflicted.Within seconds, Lucius Apparated to his home and took Harry's body to a spare room, a part of him aware of the charms being cast by the Dark Lord on the room before he told him, "Do whatever you must, Lucius: heal him, wake him up, make him betterdo anything and, when he wakes, inform me and you shall be rewarded."Lucius knew that Lord Voldemort was not one for lying about rewards, but at the same time, he couldn't help but wonder about the air of fear and shock in the man's voice. Again, the Malfoy Lord felt confusion about how the Dark Lord was almost frightened for Harry's safety and, to make things even more confusing, Lucius could tell that, for all the blood and scars and lack of life in him, the boy's scars and pains had not been caused at Voldemort's hands.Summoning an elf to fetch him what he needed, Lucius began his work;He just hoped that he wasn't too late, because then he'd lose more than his sense of right and wrong in this crazy mixed-up world right now;He'd probably wind up losing his lifeUnmasking the Snake"My Lord?"Tom felt Lucius gently shake him awake, his instinct telling him to go for his wand, but when he saw his old friend standing over him, he relented that instinct. Instead, with a twisting motion of his neck to relieve some of the tension, the Dark Lord asked, "Is everything all right, Lucius?""There is something you should see," Lucius explained, leading Tom out of the room occupied by the Dark Lord and into the guest room where Harry was lying. When he entered, Tom's eyes widened at what he saw in front of him: Harry was now completely naked save for a towel that wrapped around his waist, concealing his pride from the view of others, but that wasn't what made him gasp.Instead, it was the sight of several painful-looking runes that had been magically-painted onto Harry's shoulders, upper arms and on his Adam's apple, each of the runes looking foreign, but there was no mistaking their design. Even after all this time, the Dark Lord could tell the magical signature of that senile old fool without needing to guess.With a silent, speechless glance to Lucius, Tom's shock only increased when Lucius told him, "That's not all: look."Then, with care and precision, Lucius turned Harry's body over and the Dark Lord almost threw up with sickness and disgust: Harry's back was a heavy web of switch lashes and whip marks, some of the wounds looking new while others seemed to be slow healing. His left shoulder seemed to be dislocated, but not completely as it looked like it had been set wrong and, like the rune on his Adam's apple, Tom also noticed a second rune at the top of Harry's spinal cord."Lucius," Tom whispered, horror and fear evident in his voice as he asked, "Whatwhat are they?""The one on his spine is a magical-restraint rune," Lucius explained, his voice calm despite the horror of the situation as he explained, "The one on his Adam's apple is a nutritional neutraliser and the ones on his shoulders and arms keep him from being able to use the nutrients and magic of his body to heal the wounds. If I didn't know better, my Lord, I would swear that someone wanted Potter to feel this pain for a very long time to come. Furthermore, there is a dark curse of some sort focused on the boy's infamous lightning-bolt scar and his eyes have been damaged by years of a lack of proper prescriptions.""Dumbledore," Tom hissed, his voice as cold and menacing as the Voldemort of old, "But why? Surely he knows that Harry is his only ace-in-the-hole for taking me on and proving the Ministry wrong.""If he does," Lucius answered, "I don't think he cares anymore, my Lord: now, I've fed four different nutritional replenishments into his system, but they're doing nothing to speed up his healing. The wounds are closed and I've managed to replace the blood in him with blood replenishment draughts, but without an actual curse-breaker, I don't know how to help him. I am sorry, my Lord.""No, Lucius," Tom replied, his words like the voice of death itself as he told the man, "You've done all you can: rest assured that I shall keep my word to you, old friend. Isis there a way to wake him?""I would advise against it, my Lord," Lucius remarked, his words calm as he looked to Harry's apparently-sleeping form, "His pain is deeper than the runes and marks have worked: I don't wish to suggest it, but maybe the best thing for you to do would be to put him""Crucio," Tom hissed, the power of the Cruciatus Curse striking Lucius, but he didn't scream: instead, he endured the pain before he gasped when Tom released the spell and told him, "Never let me hear you suggest that again, Lucius, else I may forget my promise to you. No, I will not give up on Harry: he is strong and he is a fighter: he'll pull through this. In the meantime, contact Severus and bring him to me.""But my Lord," Lucius gasped, his voice shaking from the aftermath of the Crucio, "What of his allegiance to Dumbledore?""Compared to the loyalty he holds for Harry," Tom replied, "I think it's safe to say he won't be saying a word about this."Unmasking the SnakeWhen Severus appeared through Lucius' Floo Gate, he was almost terrified beyond belief when he found the red eyes of Lord Voldemort showing through the humane appearance of the Dark Lord. Next to him, Lucius looked doubtful, though Severus could see an air of warning in the man's eyes, almost as though he was warning his old friend to be very careful of what he said."You summoned me, my Lord?" asked Severus, earning a soft nod from Tom before he led him up the stairs."The time has come for choices, Severus," Tom explained, his words like ice as he walked with the Potions Master, "If you choose to remain a spy, then you spy not for me or for Dumbledore, but for the reason that I have summoned you. Furthermore, if you should succeed here, I will release you from the Mark and leave you to decide where your true loyalty lies, do I make myself clear?"Severus inclined his head, a part of him marginally scared even more than when he'd been downstairs: if the Dark Lord was offering release, then whatever he'd summoned Severus here for was serious indeed. As they reached the room, Severus then remembered what the Dark Lord had also said: his true loyalty and he'd said that the time had come for choices.As Lucius opened the door, a lead weight filled Severus' throat and, when he saw beyond the door, the weight dropped into his stomach like an anvil had just crushed it."PotterHarry" Severus gasped, approaching the bed and, kneeling down, he drew his wand and began running several spells over the boy's body. When he saw the runes, a flare of anger rose in Severus that had a few empty Potions vials smashing, but not before the man gripped the boy's hand and, lowering his head, he sobbed, "LilyI'm sorryI failed youI failed him""It is as I thought then," Tom whispered, earning a look from Severus, the sight of the Potions Master in such weakness alarming Lucius, but Tom was as calm as ever as he asked, "Your loyalty, Severus: it was never truly to me or Albus, was it?""No, Tom," Severus seethed, his tone as cold as ice as he rose and, standing over Harry as though protecting him, Severus continued, "It's him: always him and nobody else. You can curse me for this if that's what you want, but I will not repent: I can'tnow what's happened to him?""Albus has poisoned his core and stunted his growth, both physically and magically," Tom replied, his words calm as he explained, "From the set-up of the runes, it looks like he was attempting the forbidden Eight Gates Ritual to seal off Harry's potential: am I right?""One on the Adam's apple, two on the shoulders, two on the arms and one on the back of the neck," Severus replied, his voice as cold as death as he explained, "That's six: where are the other two?""One is in his scar," Lucius explained, his eyes wide with the revelation as he added, "And the last one: check the back of his headjust under the hairline."Being as gentle as he could, Severus turned Harry and, being careful with the boy as though he was made of glass, the Potions Master moved the hairline aside, revealing, just as Lucius had suspected, an eighth rune, this one almost glowing with fiery rage, though not as much as Severus felt at that moment."That senile, manipulative, murdering bastard!" Severus snapped, standing tall before he turned and added, "It's the Eight Gates all right, but the placements are all wrong: this is a curse-form of the Ritual and it's killing him!""Can you undo it?" asked Tom.With regret in his eyes, Severus answered, "Yes, but it will cause him great pain and the magical backlash will be like an atomic bomb going off: plus, even if he survives it, the mental damage will never be the same for him. I can't understand why Dumbledore would want to do this, but I refuse to let Lily's son be destroyed, especially by one they trusted so warmly.""Then do it," Tom remarked, casting several powerful wards around the room as he explained, "I will deal with the backlash myself: for all I have put this boy through, even I have my limits. Do what must be done, Severus.""Then there is one thing we need," Severus told him, a little shocked at the man's insistence for his enemy's safety."What?" asked Lucius."His owl," Severus replied, his eyes on Tom as he added, "And you would be wise giving him your wand, my Lord: as they are brothers, it should be able to help tame his magical outburst. Once we have those items, I can begin, but it is imperative that no-one enters this room until I'm done: to do otherwise would bring disastrous consequences.""I'll tell Narcissa to take Draco out, then," Lucius told his friend, giving Tom a curt bow before he turned and left the room; seconds later, the Dark Lord set his wand down on the bed and, stepping back, he vanished with a whirl of shadows, reappearing moments later with a starved, caged owl with several locks on her cage."I swear," Tom hissed, "If he dies, it will not be you who suffers, Severus: it will be those Mugglesand to make sure of that, I will introduce them to Bellatrixand Fenrir""And me," finished Severus, "Lily and Petunia's hatred for one another is well-known: if he dies, she will die screaming: I swear it."Releasing Hedwig from her cage, Severus placed the owl onto Harry's heart, the feel of the feathers and talons making Harry jerk reflexively, but then he fell still again while Tom placed his wand on one side of the owl, Severus doing the same with Harry's wand  which Tom had found in Harry's trouser pocket when he'd arrived at the manor.With a deep breath, Severus took three steps back before he explained, "You should wait outside, Tom: this is not going to be pretty.""What about you?" asked the Dark Lord, but his words were cut off when Severus conjured a white seal around his body and feet, the power of the seal keeping him safe from spell damage.Moving outside, the last thing that Tom heard was Severus lifting his wand before the Potions Master's voice commanded, "Et portae octo exaudi me spiritus meus, ego prcipio tibi, ut corpus a potentia tua quas exprobraverunt dimittere!"The magical power that burst from within the room almost sent Tom flying over the stairs, and he was standing outside the door; over and over again, the Dark Lord heard Severus repeat the spell-cast commands and again he felt the rushes of magic. If he knew his rituals, Tom believed that Severus would need to repeat the spell once for each gate and, hopefully, he would have the power to cleanse the body of young Harry of the curse that he had been held under.Finally, with the eighth command, there was a sound like a fiercely-close clap of thunder and, from the other side, Tom heard what could only be described as the world's worst scream. It was primal, powerful and magical all in one: it had no source or causes save for the pain and fury felt in the heart of one boy and, when Tom heard the scream die down, he almost feared what was on the other side.After what seemed like an eternity, Severus' head appeared around the door, his face pale and sweaty, but apparently-proud as he told the Dark Lord, "He's asking for you.""Me?" asked Tom, stepping around the door himself: what he saw before him was, quite possibly, impossible, but true.There, sat upright in bed, stroking what appeared to be a small white lioness cub, was a very handsome-looking Harry James Potter, his green eyes now replaced by a pair of bright-golden-coloured eyes that made him look hauntingly intimidating. His hair, which was once wild and untameable, was now slick and fell to his shoulders, which Tom noticed with an air of relief to be devoid of runes, scars and pains.However, where runes and scars were not, Tom did notice how drop-dead gorgeous this new boy looked: well-toned, pale-skinned to the point of eerily-handsome and with a muscular structure to his body that made him look both agile and enduringly-strong at the same time, he would be a catch for any girl, for sure.Though he knew it was wrong, Tom felt a laugh creep up in his throat as he thought, 'If I were only a few years younger'His emotions and thoughts about the boy in front of him only increased when those spine-chilling gold eyes looked up at him and, with a gentle smile, Harry spoke, "Hello Tom: I take it that you didn't accept me telling you that you'd won."The voice was as chilling as the appearance: cold and unreadable with a tone that, if he was being honest, reminded Tom of Severus and Lucius put together.As he smirked in response, Tom then answered Harry, "I couldn't let you die, Harry: there are things we must discuss.""Yes," Harry agreed, his voice cold, but amused as he asked, "For example, did you know that I'm one of your Horcruxes?"And there we go: Chapter 1 and a pretty impressive start, but this leaves questions: why did Dumbledore try to curse Harry and what did 'you win' mean?Plus, where did that lioness cub come from and how does Harry know that he's one of Tom's Horcruxes?Keep Reading to Find OutNext Chapter: Harry tells Tom the missing parts of the story and likes his new body; plus, Draco meets the new Harry and finds himself drawn in, begging for the boy's forgiveness: also, in light of Harry's submission, Tom has an offer for the young wizardPlease Read and ReviewOC Spell:Et portae octo exaudi me spiritus meus, ego prcipio tibi, ut corpus a potentia tua quas exprobraverunt dimittere: Roughly translated, it means Eight Gates, hear me: by my power, I command you to release your power from this cursed body (I say roughly because when you reverse the languages so you're translating the Latin, you get something different) Also known as the Eight Gates Key Ritual: releases the Eight Gates Curse from an unwilling bodyAN: Phew, this one took some thought, but I think I managed it; now, I know this may seem awkward, but try to be patient and trust in my creativity; also, the idea for the rite and Harry's cursed state came from my recommended read Suns of Death and Darkness; all rights to the original creator for that one;
