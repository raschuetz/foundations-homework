"I think I need you because you don't need me." The words echoed around the room as Lily sat there in silence. He looked at her with wild desperation in his face and moved to embrace her as if he wanted to kiss her."James, I can't. You know I can't." Lily took a step back from him looking into his eyes. Her emerald eyes were filled with emotion that he could not decipher. Suddenly she turned and ran from the room, not bothering to look back over her shoulder as James crumpled to the ground. He was in tears and shattered yet again by the beautiful Lily Evans, and the worst part was he would do it all again to get close to her.He would endure this heartbreaking feeling over and over just to be near her, to stroke her hair, to get close enough to count the freckles on the bridge of her nose. James Potter was madly in love and Lily Evans just didn't care. Eventually he picked himself up and hauled himself to Gryffindor tower where he passed out on one of the couches in the common room. His last thoughts as he fell asleep were of that look in her eyes, it seemed almost surprised but not at him. Like she was surprised with herself. If she did feel anything at all he would die a happy man but for now sleep floated his thoughts of Lily Evans away, for once in those 6 years he had known her he did not dream of her.- Hey guys, so I got the idea for this story and I have no clue what to really do with it so if anyone wants to send me reviews of what I should do with it or wants to commandeer it then go ahead. In my mind this is set at the end of their 6th year and its right before Lily realizes how she feels about James. I would like to write a little of what happened before this or maybe incorporate it into my other story "The Beginning" but until I get some real story writing inspiration I guess this will just be stand alone. Don't forget to review. Thanks -
