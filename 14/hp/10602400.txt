Jon stood in front of his fellow students, his housemates and friends, looking at their expectant faces nervously. He takes a deep breath and starts to smile, 'You've practiced this' he thought 'You can do this'"Ready?" He queries the small crowd, met with a cheer of approval. His eyes meet with Jemima Michell's, his Girlfriend and classmate, the look on her eyes instantly fills him with confidence and determination.He raises his wand slowly, pointing it towards the sky dramatically; slowly lowering it to his chest with a hung head. Jabbing towards the sky suddenly he says "vur-MILL-ee-us", a giant cascade of crimson sparks erupt from his wand, proceeded by four quick slashes and a subtle utterance of "vur-duh-MILL-ee-us" for each motion, sending four emerald sparks after the crimson spark.Upon contact the sparks erupt in a bright display of crimson and emerald, rather like the fireworks of the muggle world. Met with applause Jon gives a small bow and proceeds to join his classmates.
