A/N  These are J.K Rowling's Characters with a few of my own creations in there.(Alexia's POV)"Alexia, there's an owl by the study window." Shouted my Granny from the hallway with her thick welsh accent clamped to her voice."Ok, I'll go and check it now!" I shouted with my head buried into my pillow. I dragged myself out of my bed and threw on my teal dressing gown over my shoulders and slipped into my white bunny slippers. I strolled out of my bedroom to walk down the hallway decorated by my granny's favourite photos. My personal favourite has always been Granny's wedding day to Prince William (Son of George V). Granny looked so happy in that photo dancing with William. This picture was different from all the others, this one moved and it showed the couple dancing in each other arms, staring endlessy into each others eyes.I walked into the study of my Granny's home, and then I saw an unfamiliar looking owl on the study window with a letter in its beak."Hello, is this for me?" I chooed to the little brown owl as I sat down at the desk by the window. The little brown owl dropped the letter into my lap then flew off. I knew that I was beaming like a Chesire Cat as my Granny says. I read the front of the letter which read:Miss A. Granger13th Pinewood CloseLinford, LondonI turned it over to see a wax seal, I broke the seal to find 3 pieces of paper. The first read:HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRYHeadmaster: Albus Dumbledore(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed.

I have got to owl Dad he'll be so proud and gutted at the same time. I found a roll of parchment in my Granny's desk, and I pulled out an ink bottle and a quill. I wrote :Dear Dad,I thought you'll be pleased to know I have arrived safely as pure usual and it was lovely spending summer with you, Valentina, Jameous and Pavel. I'm not sure if Rayna likes me. And  I got my Hogwarts acceptance letter.Love you so muchAlexia xxxI took Alica my beige barn owl out of her cage and let her fly to dad's. I ran downstairs so fast my dressing gown was flying behind me."Granny, Granny, Granny, Granny, Granny, Granny!" I pestered as I ran downstairs."What darling?" she said popping her head from around the kitchen door."I've got my Hogwarts letter!" I shouted as I ran into my Granny's arms."Oh, Baby that's fanatasic!" Granny squealed, obviously just as exicted as I was."I'm going to go to tell mum right now!" I said grabbing a handful of Floo Powder."Not dressed like that young lady." She said looking down on my jamas that I was wearing, "Get dressed and we'll go together."I ran back upstairs into my sparkling blue room. I walked straight into my wardobe to grab a good respectable outfit. I walked out of the wardobe wearing a teal blouse, dark blue skinny jeans, black ankle heels with a cropped leather jacket. I walked pass my mirror noticing my hair was the most glimering, shiny golden blonde I'd ever seen, it felt odd because my hair changed from either baby blue or jet black.I heard a large pop from downstairs, I started to walk down the stairs slowly so I didn't fall down and seriously injure myself."Alexia!" I heard an extremely familiar voice shout from downstairs."Daddy!" I screamed as I was running down the stairs trying to take as much caution as possible. I ran straight into my dad's arms and he spun me around like always."I'm so proud of you, my little cabbage patch!" dad whispered in my ear as we hugged."But I didn't get into Durmstrang like you wanted!" I said rather confused."Who cares Albus Dumbledore is a better professor then Igor Karkaroff could ever dream of being." My dad said pulling me in for another hug.Then I heard another pop from behind my dad.A/N  Please review, favourite and follow. Next chapter will be up within the next week.
