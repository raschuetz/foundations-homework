DISCLAIMER: Harry Potter belongs to JK Rowling.A/N: The drabbles/oneshots in this collection will not be in chronological order, but are all part of the same storyline. The OCs starring in this tale are two young female Death Eaters: Lilith Goyle (birth year 1951, aunt to Gregory) and Azalais Carrow (birth year 1955, cousin to Alecto and Amycus).~ With Me, Into The Dark ~Lilith startles into wakefulness. Pain pulls at her side, but her gaze skips over the familiar sight of Azalais (beside her, healing her wounds - as usual after a mission) to land on the room's unexpected occupant.Bellatrix leans against the wall opposite the bed, her arms crossed over her chest and a faintly worried expression gracing her features.As her memories of tonight's battle slowly filter back to her, Lilith narrows her eyes and asks, "Why did you intervene?""You almost got yourself killed!" Bellatrix snaps. Any worry she might have felt evaporates at the ingrate's question."But I would have taken Moody with me," Lilith says, allowing her eyes to drift closed once more as she blissfully recalls the way her curse-infused blade parted the Auror's flesh. "Which would have been a significant loss for their side," she finishes belatedly."One worth losing your life over?" Bellatrix asks."Perhaps not," Lilith concedes, wondering idly how one would calculate the value of her services to the Noble Cause versus Moody's worth to the Ministry. "But when the Reaper comes for me, I will go gladly into his arms."~end of scene~Reviews are always appreciated.
