Waaaaa!Ch.1Gryffindor and Slytherin Transfiguration class: It was a normal day in Transfiguration class. McGonagall was boring the class as she talked about animagus when suddenly a bright light sliced through the room and Professor McGonagall had disappeared. In her place were a projector and a screen as well as Bellatrix Black, Narcissa Black, Lucius Malfoy, Regulus Black, and Albus Dumbledore.Everybody screamed as words appeared in bright purple on the screen. Bellatrix read, "Welcome to the future music of what is to occur in your near future. If you want to continue listen, if you don't you are still listening. There is a list of rules. Rule 1: Judge everyone at the end. Rule 2: Be nice or else. Rule 3: No magic can be used in this room, and if you try to your wand will disappear. You have been warned. Now sit back and enjoy the music of the future. Have fun!"Everyone gulped worriedly and then the music started.House Song by Ministry of MagicI'm a Ravenclaw I like to read books When I cast spells They're off the frickin' hookJames looked utterly confused but refrained from commenting. Sirius had no issue yelling "What the fuck!"I'm a GryffindorI'll fly with my friendsWe'll never back down And fight to the endAll of the Gryffindors yelled, "Got that right!" The Slytherins just sneered.I'm a SlytherinI am very richI'll go on a date With whoever gets the snitchTo say the Slytherins objected was a little bit of an understatement.I'm a Hufflepuff Just stayin' relaxedGimme drinks and friendsNo feuds we got tactSirius yelled, "Any Hufflepuff supporters in the room. No, oh alright." He sat down with an exaggerated huff and everyone looked at him strangely.[Speaking](Slytherin): Ew, who brought the Hufflepuff?Sirius stood up indignantly and said, "Hey! Be nice."(Hufflepuff): Hey, I'm just trying to have a good time over here."Go Huffle!" Sirius cheered.James looked over at Remus, "I think he's finally cracked."The look Remus gave said Finally when was he ever sane?Have a good timeA good timeI'm a Ravenclaw I got wit beyond measureI can catch a snitch like it's caught up in a tetherBoth houses yelled, "When has that ever happened?"I'm a SlytherinThe house of the snakeCome get in my way And get tossed in the lakeSirius and James snorted, "You can't compete with Gryffindor awesomeness."Lilly glared at them even though she was no longer friends with Severus.I'm a Gryffindor And we own the skyYeah, we always win With our rally cry"We have a rally cry?! I didn't know that. Why wasn't I informed of this? I am a chaser on the team!" Frank cried."Don't worry Frank, I never knew either." James consoled his friend.I'm a SlytherinThe top of my classIf you disagreeI'll kick your Muggle ass"Well that's not nice to say!" Lilly said, "I don't say that if you disagree with me I'll kick you in the rear."[Speaking](Alex): Uh, Alan, do you even know what Harry Potter is?(Alan): Well, I haven't read the books, but I've seen all the movies!Everyone asked, "Who's Harry Potter?!""James, did you do something I need to know of," Sirius asked seriously.James turned bright red and mumbled something no one could hear as the song continued on.Let's beat him upLet's beat him up"Why would you beat someone for that?" Alice asked.All the Slytherins refrained from sneering though Bellatrix just barely.I'm a Slytherin A big fan of Snape "What the fuck!" The Slytherins and everyone else for the matter were confused especially Severus.If it's a MoM album We have to say Snape"Why is Severus so important?"

Everyone yelled, but the screen had a mind of its own and started to play another song.
