Ginny and Harry had been dating for three years,since the Battle of was their aniversary,and everyone expected Harry to propose hoped it would be one knew what Harry was waiting practically lived together,which everyone but knew.Harry wouldn't tell Ginny where he was taking her,all she knew was that it was in Muggle London and she needed to dress nicely. She was just finishing the dress Harry had recently bought her,when she heard the doorbell of her Hollyhead flat."Come in!"Ginny called excitedly.Ginny soon felt those all to familiar arms slip around her waist,and Harry rested his stubbly chin on her shoulder."Guess who?" "Hmmm...Taylor Lautner?"Ginny giggled while snaking around to peck Harry on the cheek."Hello, are you going to tell me were we're going?""It wouldn't be much of a surprise if I did that,now would it?"Thirty minutes later Ginny found herself in her favorite restraunt,the one she and Harry had their first date was an Italian restraunt called Chizella's .Harry had even reserved the booth they had sat both ordered the same thing they had ordered then, but after dinner Ginny was surprised when a beautiful chocolate cae they hadn't ordered came to the looking at it she saw there was a box on a cardboard platform,a ring box.Harry stood and grabbed the ring box,getting down on one knee in front of an already misty-eyed Ginny. "Ginerva Molly Weasley will you marry me?"Ginny could only nod,everyone in the packed restraunt had been listening and now threw herself into Harry's arms.
