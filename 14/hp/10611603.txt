Hello fan fiction readers, there's a couple of things I most say, first of all I will not abandon this story and I plan to rewrite Rising Of The Unknown, but I really have to say sorry for my lack of updates and the progress of my story. There was some complications that were happening now that its settled I'm going to focus on my writing and this story is on the top on the list. I will update the first chapter this week or next week before my school starts on the 25th.Thank you all who review and favorite, and followed my story it meant a lot to me and I hope you will continue to do in the future!*kisses*
