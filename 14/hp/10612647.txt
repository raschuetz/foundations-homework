WHY?"Why Draco? Just explain it to me. Please."She was fed up. Fed up of him being so mean all the time.Draco put his pale hands on her unsteady shoulders and gazed into the watery eyes that were peering at him uncertainly. He couldn't bear seeing her like this."I'm sorry. I don't do it deliberately." he replied solemnly and trying to soothe her added, "I promise not to be mean any more."She sniffed and his heart lurched as she asked him a final question. "Why were you even being mean in the first place?"Draco sighed, closed his eyes and moved his pounding head closer to hers until their faces were just inches away and he searched her eyes dramatically."Because...I love you Hermione."
