Please Review!~Mystique POV She is four years old~I was playing in the backyard with my friend, Mary."Give me the ball, Mysti!" She squealed."I want the ball, Mary!" I howled. We fought over the ball. My eyes narrowed, and I had a dark look on my face.Suddenly Mary screamed. I chanced a look behind me.But behind meA whole bunch of floating dudes with cloaks. What did Mom call them? Oh right. Dementor.Mom came out and screamed. She raised her wand and shouted "Expecto Patronum!"Suddenly I heard screaming. Not human screaming. Dementor screaming. I was too young to understand then. But I did understand that Mom was hurting them with her wand. I turned to her."Stop, Mommy." I said in a serious voice, or as serious as a four year old could be (which is no small amount!).Mom, astonished, lowered her wand. The screaming stopped.Suddenly she sighed. I turned back around, and they were gone.Dad was staring at me from their study. Soon I realized everyone was staring at me. Everyone around the block. I was embarrassed and ran inside.In my bedroom, Mom came in shaking her head."Mary had to be escorted to St. Mungo's. She'll be fine." She quickly assured me, about to break into tears again."Oh, Mysti, how did it happen? My little Mysti.""I- I don't know." I said, my voice quivering. "I-I got angry at Mary, and- and we fought- and  they came."Mommy studied me intently. "Little Mysti, you have big powers. Please  please try to control them."I widened my eyes at her. "I don't know how I did that, Mommy. I just remember doing it.But I did know. I had wanted them to come, unconsciously. But I summoned them. I called them.
