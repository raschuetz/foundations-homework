Chapter 1, Beauty & The Beast.Tonks smiled as she watched Teddy play with his little sister as she babbled at him from where she was in her baby swing her hair turning a soft purple as she became interested in her teething ring either than her brother.Teddy sat next to his mother on the couch and laughed as she pulled him into her lap kissing his cheek as she held him close."When your sister wakes up from her nap we get to go and see daddy and Sirius."Teddy looked up at his mother cocking his head to one side."Where is daddy?"Tonks kissed her son's head before setting him next to her as she got up and carefully took her sleeping daughter out of the swing and took her to the nursery laying her in the crib, she looked at Teddy who had climbed up on the stool next to the crib and was watching his sister."Daddy and the others are talking at Grimmauld Place."She smiled picking him up and left the room, the door open a crack incase Lyra woke early though she rarely did, Tonks had been opted out for the meeting today as were a few of the others and she had a feeling it was over the new string of attacks from the werewolves that had escaped the battle with their lives and had dodged the ministry throwing them into Azkaban.She shook the thought from her head as she laid on the couch with Teddy sitting on her stomach as she crossed her ankles where they hung over the arm, Teddy smiled before getting down and grabbing the fake wand he'd received from George as a birthday gift and aimed it at her making her raise an eyebrow."Drop your wand and surrender dark witch!"He tried not to laugh as he watched her smirk before she jumped to her feet dropping her wand to the floor."Put your hands up, no funny business."Tonks got to her knees holding her hands up trying not to laugh as she made her brown hair a deep raven color impersonating her aunt."How dare you take a witch's wand and try to take me to Azkaban?"Teddy pointed the toy wand at her with a stern look but his eyes were joking."Quite Lestrange or I'll hand you to the dementors!"He pointed to the small pile of stuffed animals in the coroner making his mom laugh under her breath her hair changing pink for a moment before it went back as she looked at his wand aimed at her and smirked."You'll never take me alive young arour!"She imitated her aunt's cackle best she could and scooped him up in a hug as he laughed dropping his wand as he tried to squirm away from her as she tickled him, he managed to get out of her hold as she stopped tickling him.She watched him as he picked up her wand handing to to her with the tip pointed down so it wasn't pointed at either of them, she took it smiling at him."Thank you sweetie."She tucked it in her back pocket as she got up listening for a moment to make sure Lyra wasn't woken by their fun, she stumbled onto the couch when Teddy gave a small growl and pounced at her wrapping his arms around her waist, she managed to land on the couch so she avoided hurting him and herself as well as avoiding breaking her wand.She gasped breathless as he sat on her stomach."Now what did you do that for?"She looked at her son who was looking down his hair a dark blue."Sorry mummy."She smiled softly hugging him, he was a bit surprised as he felt her arms around him."Your mine now young arour!"She smirked as he laughed squirming out of her hold to the floor looking for his wand, which she held up as he looked at her."Lose something?"He seemed to look scared for a moment but gave a smirk of his own jumping onto the couch and snatching the toy from her standing on the arm of the couch aiming at her."Taking an arour's wand and working for the dark side are offenses to the ministry and so I take you in chains to Azkaban for life!"Tonks felt her body react before she could comprehend what was happening, suddenly she had her own wand in her hand and was ready to draw it but the door opening stopped her reflex from allowing her to do so.She looked at the door forgetting her son standing in front of her as Remus came into the room raising an eyebrow at the scene before him, she looked at Teddy who had lowered his wand looking at his father.Tonks felt herself blush as Remus chuckled looking between the two of them."Playing dark wizard catcher?"Teddy nodded sitting in his mom's lap as she let her hair turn pink from the black it was as she sighed holding him close."I guess it's true, old habits did hard."She chuckled looking back at her husband as he made his way to her kissing her head."What are you going to do when he gets old enough to have a real wand?"She looked down at Teddy as he got off the couch and was heading to Lyra's room hearing her stir."I'll teach him like Mad-eye taught me, but aside from that it sounds like your daughter knows your home and you get to put her back down for a nap."She smirked like it would be a challenge to get her back to sleep, granted the little girl didn't sleep like her older brother had, she was a light sleeper like her mother but also just like her mother she was very fond of Remus.He kissed her head before fallowing Teddy to Lyra's room opening the door as the little girl began to cry."Teddy come here."Teddy came to his mother's side as she got up, he took her hand as she held it out, he led him quietly past Lyra's room to his and once inside she sat on the bed."We need to pack your things for tonight."Teddy looked a little confused making Tonks chuckle as she pointed to the window."Mummy and daddy have to change tonight sweetheart."Teddy nodded gathering his things quickly then got on the bed next to her looking up at her with big puppy eyes that broke her heart and her will to say no."Mummy can I come with please?"Tonks looked down at him messing up his hair giving him a broken smile."No sweetie, your father would be very upset if I brought you with, and if something happened to you we would both be very very upset."Teddy pouted turning away from her his hair turning red as he crossed his arms over his chest."Come on little man don't be mad with me, you'll understand just how dangerous it would be to bring you a long."Teddy huffed a growl refusing to turn around but his hair lightened a shade as she put a hand on his back."Tell you what, how about if you go to Harry's tonight and Lyra goes to grandma's? I know Harry wants to see you again and they will be going to Molly's tonight so you'll see Fleur and Victorie."Teddy finally looked at her with a smile on his face his hair turning bright yellow as he jumped up."Can I mummy please!?"She chuckled catching him before he could fall off the bed before pulling him into her lap."I'll ask Harry and see what he says about it, okay?"Teddy nodded getting out of her lap and going to the door all but bouncing as he waited for her, she shook her head getting up and fallowing him back to the living room, Teddy had always been fascinated by her patronus and her casting it when he was fussy had only fueled that.She sat on the couch and pulled him into her lap as she cast the charm giving the silvery white werewolf her message before sending it off as Remus quietly left Lyra's room and coming into the living room getting a scowl from his wife."She is such a daddy's girl already it isn't even funny, your in there 5 minutes and she goes right to sleep, I'm in there up to an hour before she falls asleep for me."She chuckled shaking her head as he put his hands on her shoulders."Teddy was the same way with you till he turned a year old."Tonks laid her head on the back of the couch looking up at him."She acts just like her mother pink hair and all."She chuckled as he leaned down and kissed her lovingly, she purred agents his lips letting it turn into a soft growl as he deepened the kiss, she broke the kiss as Teddy got down from her lap making her look away reluctantly in time to see the brown owl run face first into the chair across from them, she couldn't stop the face palm as she looked at the bird as it got up a letter in it's beak."She had to send the owl, couldn't send a patronus that wouldn't break my windows!"She grumbled as she got up going to the owl and taking the letter growling as it flew into the window before out the open on, she shook her head opening the letter and reading it over with Teddy tugging her arm to try and see the letter nearly pulling her off her unsteady feet."Teddy don't you'll make mummy fall over."He stopped tugging her arm but kept standing on his tip toes as she read."You can stay with them as long as I take you to the burrow."Teddy smiled happily forgetting he had a hold of his mom's arm as he jumped and ended pulling both them to the floor with Tonks giving a yelp as she landed on her back side next to her son."Ow! Okay that hurt."She got up rubbing her lower back wincing at the bruise as it formed, Teddy got up looking down sheepishly his hair turning a pale blue."I'm sorry mummy."Tonks smiled at him and scooped him up in a hug kissing his head."It's okay sweetheart you didn't mean to, besides mummy's done worse to herself."She held him close looking down as she felt his hand on the ropey scar on her shoulder that was now exposed by her shirt being pulled down, she set him down fixing her shirt before glancing outside as the movement hurt her bones and joints."Go get your bag sweetie and I'll take you to the burrow."Teddy hurried off the get his bag and she whined as she felt her chest burn, it was getting late and if she didn't make the trip quick she'd transform outside the burrow and have the risk of hurting someone.Remus saw her worried glances out the window as Teddy came back from his room."You hurry and take him I'll take Lyra to your mother try not to transform if you can help it."She nodded swallowing the lump in her throat as she picked Teddy up and hurried out the door apparating quickly to the burrow, she set Teddy on his feet on the door step after kissing his cheek as Bill opened the door looking at her a bit worried."Tonkie the moon is nearly up you won't make it back in time."Tonks looked panicked over her shoulder and with a whimper stepped back from the pair in front of her as she doubled over bitting back a scream.Bill acted as fast as he could drawing his wand but it was to late with a deafening scream she began to transform her bones snapping sickeningly as she fell to the ground her eyes locking on Teddy as he stood behind Bill and now Harry both with their wands trained on her as the change completed leaving her panting on the ground whimpers rolling off her lips.Her wolf lay still for a moment letting the pain pass when a gust of wind blew the unfamiliar scents to it's nose causing it to raise and growl at the two men before it.Bill stepped closer to the she wolf his wand still out but so was his free hand as he got closer until the wolf's growls became feral, the wind blew again blowing Teddy's sent to it and this time the wolf whined it's mothering instincts telling her it was her pup but all she seen was the boy watching her from behind a strangers legs.She gave a growl swatting Bill's wand from his hand and pushing him over with a paw before going to Harry ignoring his shaky threats as she lowered herself to her belly looking at the boy sniffing and again her instincts told her that he was a pup and she whined again."Harry let Teddy go to her, she won't hurt him."Harry looked at Bill as if he was mad before clenching his jaw and pointing his wand at the wolf."Don't!"Bill tried to warn him but it was to late, the wolf was spooked and lashed out bringing Harry down with her weight as she stood over him her paw on his chest as she snarled her teeth inches from his neck when a small whimper made her freeze.She looked at Teddy as he let out another whimper making her forget about Harry under her paw as she gave a soft whine back before taking a step closer to him cringing when the child reached out his hand as he'd seen Bill do, the wolf closed the gap and sniffed his hand before nudging it with her muzzle seeming to be tamed by the boy as he ran his fingers through her brown fur.She turned away blocking Teddy as Bill got to his feet favoring a leg his ankle sprained at least by her lash out at him, he put his wand away showing her empty hands though she still growled protectively feeling Teddy nuzzle into her side doing what he could to try and keep her from hurting someone.The wolf jumped and yelped shocked when it felt something painful strike it's back and with a growl turned to face the door barring it's teeth at the red head girl that stood there that now had Teddy behind her though he was protesting greatly kicking up a tantrum.Ginny's hand shook as she took aim again and used the first spell that rolled off her tongue, a cruciatus curse making her fall to the ground yelping and howling in pain, Bill swore as he heard an answering howl not far off and as Ginny's concentration was broken by Teddy getting out of her grip the she wolf howled again hearing it's mates calls.Teddy went to his mother placing his hand to her neck burring his face in the fur of her shoulder giving a whine that even the wolf could tell was real as she moved carefully and licked his cheek with a whine of her own.It didn't take Remus long to figure his wife wouldn't make it back before the moon claimed her so he had gone to where he knew he'd find her letting himself change and answering her howls when he heard them, he ran as fast as his soar body would allow as her howls stopped fear for it's mate pushing it faster with each stride.He finally made it to where he could see his mate laying on the ground a human child nuzzled into her fur running his fingers through it as she ignored it as if it was normal her head on her paws only a growl escaping her lips when one of the others got to close than she'd like.The wolf made his way carefully to his mate sniffing carefully as he got closer shooting glances at the others by the door before he nudged his mates muzzle with his getting a huff from her as she looked at the boy as he petted her fur glancing at the other wolf now and again.The wolf gave a low growl sniffing Teddy who froze in place as soon as he heard it and remained still as the male sniffed him before snorting and sitting on it's haunches then laying down began to groom the she wolf who didn't object as she closed her eyes.From the door of the burrow Bill sighed as Molly wrapped his sprained ankle."Tonks' wolf must have recognized Teddy or his scent other wise she wouldn't be sitting out there letting him do that to her, but Remus' wolf is harder to figure out, males don't normally get involved with pups so they don't always tolerate them around his mate but he can tell if they are his pups."Harry was watching closely from the window as the two wolves settled down, Tonks' was standing to shake out her fur as a protest to her mates continues grooming only to lay back down as Teddy watched her and smiled when she'd nudge his cheek with her muzzle.She gave a yelp as the male beside her nipped her back harshly as she nudged the boy, she turned on him growling her fur bristling and her teeth bared at her mate.The male growled back but stayed low to the ground as she looked over him growling, Bill watched with Harry as the dispute settled it's self quickly with Tonks laying back down with Teddy who petted her muzzle lightly giggling when she nudged his hand then sniffed his neck tickling him.Bill narrowed his eyes as he glanced at the moon then back to the pair of wolves Tonks now on her back before rolling back over her back to Teddy as she whined to the male who rose to his feet and sniffed her gently nipping her fur."Harry have Teddy come to you slowly but if she turn around don't move."Harry stood and reached out his hand to Teddy who got to his feet and slowly made his way to his godfather, Tonks' wolf glanced at the two but did nothing as she rose to her feet nudging Remus' wolf off her before she dashed to the hill whimpering for him to fallow.Harry got Teddy in the house though he was protesting it as Harry glanced at Bill as the wolves vanished over the hill."How did you know she wouldn't bite my head off for taking Teddy away?"Bill looked at the moon with a heavy sigh."Mating season, she feels the pup, or Teddy in this case, is old enough she can mate again but if Lyra were here she would have given Remus a good bash to the head and a hard bite for trying to push her to mate."Harry looked a bit shocked recalling the way Tonks' wolf had reacted to being nipped on her back."That was pushing to to do that? It looked like she was ready to kill him."He shook his head as Bill shrugged."It happens, if a female isn't willing to mate she'll show it how she did but if the urge sets in she'll make her own advances."He shook his head as he crossed his arms, Teddy sat by the window till he started to fall asleep his head on his hand as he closed his eyes his head lolling forward so his forehead was on the cool glass.Harry seen him now asleep and picked him up putting a hand on Ginny's shoulder gesturing to the door, as she got up Bill watched them out of the corner of his eye."You won't get past the steps."Harry ignored his warning and opened the door and stepping down the steps but once his foot touched the ground a snarl broke the quite night air and he seen the pair of yellow eyes in the moon light rise from the ground not 10 feet away.He quickly stepped back onto the step watching as the wolf laid back down with a huff but kept it's eyes on him."I told you, she won't leave till dawn when she changes back."He looked at Tonks' wolf closed it's eyes for a moment before looking up at the moon and standing, Teddy stirred in Harry's arms opening his eyes looking around, the wolf didn't miss the movement and closed the space between her and Harry nudging Teddy's shoulder ignoring Harry completely.Teddy smiled at his mother petting her muzzle as she closed her eyes."I'm okay mummy."The wolf whined but stepped away from them before going back to where she was laying before, Bill looked at Harry and his sister placing a hand on Ginny's shoulder."I think it's okay to go now, she was worried about Teddy."Teddy got out of Harry's hold and went to his mother's wolf stopping a short distance from her after hearing a warning growl from next to her, he looked at Remus' grey wolf as it growled again at him but stopped as his mate snapped at him before she turned to Teddy a bit surprised when he kissed her nose before smiling at her as he went back to Ginny taking her hand.The wolf watched as the trio apparated away, she nudged her mate as she laid beside him with a small huff, her mate lifted his head and licked her muzzle before laying his head on his paws.Tonks was woken up in the morning by cold bitting her bones, she opened her eyes grimacing as she forced herself up, it took her a moment to get her bearings and when she did she wanted to cry praying the metallic taste on her lips wasn't someone she knew.She forced herself up wincing as her bones screamed their protest, she looked down at herself with a sigh as she seen the shredded remains of her clothing and as she looked down the blood dripped from her chin, trying not to panic yet she checked herself over seeing a red and raw gash on her forearm and with a sigh she looked around her seeing Remus still out on the ground where she had been and just a few steps from where she was lay a rabbit that she assumed her wolf had killed explaining the blood in her mouth.She sighed again this time in annoyance as she used Aguamenti to quickly rinse the blood from her mouth and face letting the stream trickle over her hair as she shook and pulled leaves out grumbling.Some time between her grumbling at her hair and managing to repair her clothing enough she was covered, Remus woke up summoning his clothes and dressing before walking up behind his wife wrapping his arms around her waist.She relaxed into his hold closing her eyes as she laid her head on his shoulder her damp hair turning brown and grew out so it fell over his shoulder."What are you doing here love? I thought you'd have made it to the normal place."He kissed her head holding her closer."I had a feeling you wouldn't make it back so I came to you."She opened her eyes turning them blue to match his making him blush a bit."You do realize we are outside the borrow, I woke up with blood all over my face with a gash on my wrist and a half eaten rabbit over there right?"He looked at the burrow then to her wrist that was raw and red still before he looked back at her, her eyes were laced with worry as they looked back shifting back to her soft grey from the blue she was wearing.Remus was about to say something worry filling his eyes when she looked away at the door as it opened with Bill leaning agents the door frame his arms crossed and Tonks felt her heart twist painfully as she glimpsed he was favoring a leg."Before you ask what happened you should know Teddy is with Harry and Ginny so he's safe."She felt the twist easy it's hold a little but not much as she worried still."You didn't have time to get away before you changed, I made the mistake of stepping in your way and you pinned me to the ground spraining my ankle in the process, had it not been for Teddy's scent you probably would have done the same to Harry. I'm guessing your wolf knew Teddy's scent and registered him as your pup so your wolf let him around her rather impressive seeing a 3 year old sit with a full grown female werewolf petting her like a dog. You were rather protective of him to gave Remus a good snapping at more then once from growling at him when he was curling up to you."Remus blushed faintly at how protective he had been of his wife to growl at their son and Tonks couldn't stop the laugh that bubbled over her lips."Just like his mother, fearless to no end."She looked at Bill as he shifted a slight amount of his weight to his bad ankle."I'm sorry Bill, I guess my wolf seen you as a threat, I am how every grateful that you risked yourself to keep Teddy and the others safe so thank you."She smiled and Bill shook his head as he rolled his eyes."It's nothing call it a reflex nothing much."After thanking him Tonks took Remus' hand and apparited to Harry's looking at the door as it opened and Teddy came running out into his mothers arms as she smiled."Morning sweetheart, bright and early as normal."Teddy hugged her neck smiling."I've been up since dawn mummy, Ginny and Harry are still sleeping."Tonks looked at him as she picked him up with a worried look."Maybe you should stay here so they don't think some one took you or you ran off."Teddy whined staying close to her his grey eyes begging her in a way she couldn't refuse."I don't think I'd think that for a moment Tonks, if it were any normal night and not after a full moon."Tonks looked back at the door seeing Ginny leaning on the frame her arms crossed though she was smirking, she looked at Teddy in his mothers hold."He's been wide awake since the break of dawn I heard him come down the steps and run out here so I figured you and Remus were here."Teddy blushed sticking his tongue out at her making them laugh."Sorry, he's always woke up at the break of dawn like his father and full moons are worse he'll be up all night some times."She chuckled as her son yawned as if to prove her point."Thank you Ginny, I'm sorry if I frightened you or Harry last night."Ginny shook her head."Nothing to worry about promise, nothing Harry hasn't faced before either."Out of the corner of her eye Tonks seen her husband shudder at the memory of Harry's third year when he'd transformed in front of Harry and the others.She nodded shifting Teddy to her hip so she could take her husbands hand with a small reassuring smile."Never the less thank you for taking him I hope he wasn't to much trouble."Ginny shook her head waving bye to Teddy as they left, once in the house after picking Lyra up from Andormeda's Remus put her in her room letting her sleep while Tonks laid down on the couch with Teddy asleep on her chest already, she couldn't stop the smile as Remus came back and had her sit up before he sat down and had her use his lap as a pillow.He watched with a smile as she closed her eyes her hair turning from the soft purple to pink before fadeing to brown as she fell into a light sleep.
