He loved me because I was fragile.He never had a say in his life. Everything was decided for him. From where he spent his time, to the people he could associate with. He was weak, he never fought back. He simply did as he was told out of fear of repurcussion.So when we met for the first time I didn't pay him much attention. Then again I never paid anyone much attention. I was afraid of the world around me. I relied on my bodygaurd to keep me safe from harm. I couldn't defend myself, couldn't handle anything too stressful. I was weak, fragile.He could sense it from the moment my name left his fathers lips.After then our lives were turned upside down. We were left alone together everytime our fathers had to attend a meeting. He would taunt me and toy with me. Scare me to near death and then make me feel as safe as I ever had. He made me hate him, but in the end he just made me love him.Our world was a dangerous one and no one could ever be trusted. But I trusted him, I trusted him with my life, my love, my everything. Every single first I had with him. He was the real begining of my life, the 19 years prior leading up to the moment of our meeting.He's gone now. I don't know where, I don't know why. I only know he was called away by those scary men in masks and I haven't seen him since. One whole year has passed. The war is over but he still has yet to return.I love him. I always have. I always will. Even staring down the point of a Death Eaters wand I claim this. I've loved him from the moment I laid eyes on his snowy white hair, his sad grey eyes. As the wizard in front of me says his spell, as the green light bursts from his wand I know that I could never have denied my love.I loved him for all his beautiful sadness. He loved me because I was fragile. But even in death I will not regret my love for that boy.My one, my only, my Draco Malfoy.
